1
00:01:04,765 --> 00:01:05,933
What did you eat?

2
00:01:07,977 --> 00:01:09,728
You had rations for two weeks.

3
00:01:09,812 --> 00:01:11,772
You were inside for nearly four months.

4
00:01:12,773 --> 00:01:14,233
I don't remember eating.

5
00:01:17,444 --> 00:01:19,405
How long did you think you were inside?

6
00:01:21,907 --> 00:01:22,741
Days.

7
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:25,286
Maybe weeks.

8
00:01:29,248 --> 00:01:30,958
What happened to Josie Radek?

9
00:01:39,925 --> 00:01:41,760
-I don't know.

10
00:01:42,928 --> 00:01:43,762
Thorensen? Dead.

11
00:01:49,268 --> 00:01:50,185
Ventress?

12
00:01:55,566 --> 00:01:56,442
I don't know.

13
00:01:58,277 --> 00:01:59,653
Then what do you know?

14
00:02:57,044 --> 00:02:59,046
This is a cell.

15
00:03:00,089 --> 00:03:03,967
Like all cells,
it is born from an existing cell.

16
00:03:04,802 --> 00:03:05,886
And by extension,

17
00:03:06,345 --> 00:03:09,348
all cells were ultimately born
from one cell.

18
00:03:10,349 --> 00:03:13,811
A single organism alone on planet Earth,

19
00:03:13,894 --> 00:03:15,562
perhaps alone in the universe.

20
00:03:16,188 --> 00:03:18,023
About four billion years ago...

21
00:03:19,316 --> 00:03:21,443
one became two, two became four.

22
00:03:22,486 --> 00:03:25,406
Then eight, 16, 32.

23
00:03:26,323 --> 00:03:28,409
The rhythm of the dividing pair...

24
00:03:29,535 --> 00:03:33,956
which becomes the structure
of every microbe,

25
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:36,792
blade of grass, sea creature,
land creature...

26
00:03:37,501 --> 00:03:38,377
and human.

27
00:03:38,794 --> 00:03:41,505
The structure of everything that lives...

28
00:03:42,423 --> 00:03:44,800
and everything that dies.

29
00:03:45,384 --> 00:03:48,929
As students of medicine,
as the doctors of tomorrow,

30
00:03:49,096 --> 00:03:50,431
this is where you come in.

31
00:03:51,515 --> 00:03:55,227
The cell we're looking at is from a tumor.

32
00:03:55,477 --> 00:03:58,897
Female patient, early 30s,
taken from the cervix.

33
00:03:59,273 --> 00:04:00,691
Over the course of the next term,

34
00:04:00,774 --> 00:04:03,610
we will be closely examining cancer cells
in vitro

35
00:04:03,694 --> 00:04:05,654
and discussing autophagic activity.

36
00:04:06,697 --> 00:04:08,699
Hey, Katie.

37
00:04:08,782 --> 00:04:10,909
I read the John Sulston paper
last night.

38
00:04:10,993 --> 00:04:12,786
I still feel like
I'm not working hard enough.

39
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:14,413
I'm behind the other students.

40
00:04:14,496 --> 00:04:17,166
-They find everything easier.
 You aren't, and they don't.

41
00:04:17,249 --> 00:04:18,292
-Lena!

42
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:21,462
Dan.

43
00:04:22,296 --> 00:04:25,174
I've been looking for you at lunch,
but you never seem to be around.

44
00:04:26,008 --> 00:04:27,509
I've been catching up on some writing.

45
00:04:27,593 --> 00:04:30,804
All work and no play, it sounds...
not healthy.

46
00:04:32,765 --> 00:04:34,349
I wanted to ask,

47
00:04:34,725 --> 00:04:36,810
Sarah and I have a few people over.

48
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,398
A garden party while the weather holds.

49
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:44,693
Actually, I do have plans.

50
00:04:45,152 --> 00:04:46,320
I think it'll be fun.

51
00:04:46,403 --> 00:04:49,865
Thanks, Dan, I really appreciate it,
but I'm going to paint our bedr--

52
00:04:50,282 --> 00:04:51,116
The bedroom.

53
00:04:54,328 --> 00:04:55,412
It's been a year, Lena.

54
00:04:58,665 --> 00:05:01,835
You're allowed to come to a barbecue.
It is not a betrayal

55
00:05:02,419 --> 00:05:04,087
or an insult to his memory.

56
00:05:07,007 --> 00:05:08,634
I'm gonna paint the bedroom.

No one knew anything about your unit.

92
00:07:50,212 --> 00:07:51,630
I contacted everyone.

93
00:07:52,172 --> 00:07:53,256
Everyone I could.

94
00:07:53,882 --> 00:07:56,134
The other partners knew
just as little as me.

95
00:08:01,765 --> 00:08:02,849
Was it covert?

96
00:08:05,227 --> 00:08:06,937
Mm... Maybe.

97
00:08:07,646 --> 00:08:09,690
What does that mean, "maybe"?

98
00:08:11,984 --> 00:08:14,778
Okay, yeah, it was covert.
Yeah, I think so.

99
00:08:15,237 --> 00:08:16,405
Pakistan again?

100
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:22,577
I-- I don't know where it was, or...

101
00:08:25,247 --> 00:08:26,081
what it was.

102
00:08:26,164 --> 00:08:29,626
How is that possible?
 Was it warm?

103
00:08:30,627 --> 00:08:31,461
Was there snow?

104
00:08:32,004 --> 00:08:36,508
Did the people there speak Portuguese,
or Swahili, or Pashto?

105
00:08:41,221 --> 00:08:42,764
How long have you been back?

106
00:08:43,849 --> 00:08:44,725
I don't know.

107
00:08:44,808 --> 00:08:47,185
How'd you get back?
What base did you fly into?

108
00:08:49,104 --> 00:08:52,232
-I don't know.

109
00:08:55,277 --> 00:08:57,320
You must be able to tell me something.

110
00:08:58,363 --> 00:09:01,033
You vanished off the face of the earth
for 12 months.

111
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,744
I deserve a better explanation
than no explanation.

112
00:09:03,827 --> 00:09:04,911
Does it matter?

113
00:09:28,018 --> 00:09:29,019
Kane...

114
00:09:30,562 --> 00:09:31,980
how did you get home?

115
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,274
Hmm?

116
00:09:35,901 --> 00:09:37,027
I was outside.

117
00:09:38,653 --> 00:09:39,905
Outside the house?

118
00:09:41,364 --> 00:09:42,199
No.

119
00:09:43,116 --> 00:09:44,659
No, I was outside the room.

120
00:09:47,329 --> 00:09:48,789
The room with the bed.

121
00:09:50,707 --> 00:09:52,250
The door was open, and...

122
00:09:54,294 --> 00:09:55,337
I saw you.

123
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,009
I recognized you.

124
00:10:05,222 --> 00:10:06,223
Your face.

125
00:10:21,029 --> 00:10:22,447
I don't feel very well.

126
00:10:31,414 --> 00:10:32,499
Stay with me, baby.

127
00:10:32,582 --> 00:10:34,835
-I'm right here with you.

128
00:10:34,918 --> 00:10:37,337
Male, 31, hemorrhage, in seizure.

129
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:39,840
Stay with me, baby. I love you.

130
00:10:39,923 --> 00:10:42,342
Baby, look at me. Can you do something?!

131
00:10:46,138 --> 00:10:47,722
You call for a police escort?

132
00:10:57,691 --> 00:10:59,109
Hey, easy, easy!

133
00:11:11,872 --> 00:11:13,123
Out of the truck, now!

134
00:11:13,206 --> 00:11:15,125
What are you doing?

135
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:16,835
Out!
 Don't shoot!

136
00:11:16,918 --> 00:11:18,336
Out! Move!

137
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:19,671
Out, out, out!

138
00:11:19,754 --> 00:11:20,922
What's going on?

139
00:11:21,715 --> 00:11:23,800
What are you doing?
You can't move him!

140
00:11:23,884 --> 00:11:26,511
Let him go! Let him go!

141
00:11:29,139 --> 00:11:30,515
Let him go!

142
00:12:30,659 --> 00:12:32,160
You must be feeling dreadful.

143
00:12:32,994 --> 00:12:35,830
It's a hangover
from the sedative you were given.

144
00:12:36,623 --> 00:12:37,707
Come on, sit down.

145
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:43,255
Who are you?

146
00:12:53,598 --> 00:12:55,308
My name is Dr. Ventress.

147
00:12:56,434 --> 00:12:57,686
I'm a psychologist.

148
00:12:58,436 --> 00:13:00,522
Why am I talking to a psychologist?

149
00:13:03,275 --> 00:13:04,567
Am I in a psychiatric hospital?

150
00:13:04,985 --> 00:13:06,695
-No.
 Then what?

151
00:13:07,404 --> 00:13:08,363
Where am I?

152
00:13:09,781 --> 00:13:11,032
Where's my husband?

153
00:13:11,783 --> 00:13:13,994
You served in the military
for seven years.

154
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:18,331
I'm a professor from Johns Hopkins.

155
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:20,917
I want to know what the fuck
I'm doing here.

156
00:13:21,001 --> 00:13:25,547
Your research area is the genetically
programmed life cycle of a cell.

157
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:27,048
Where is my husband?

158
00:13:27,132 --> 00:13:30,093
Yeah,
I'd like to talk about Sergeant Kane.

159
00:13:31,636 --> 00:13:33,471
When did he arrive back home?

160
00:13:36,266 --> 00:13:39,019
-I want to see a lawyer.
-You're not gonna be able to.

161
00:13:44,357 --> 00:13:46,026
Did he explain how he got back?

162
00:13:47,944 --> 00:13:50,613
-No.
-Did he contact you at any point

163
00:13:50,697 --> 00:13:51,781
while he was away?

164
00:13:52,407 --> 00:13:53,325
No.

165
00:13:54,617 --> 00:13:57,495
What did he tell you
about his mission when he returned?

166
00:13:58,538 --> 00:14:00,415
-Nothing.

167
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:03,376
Did he ever mention where he was going,
what he was doing?

168
00:14:03,752 --> 00:14:05,253
He never said, I never asked.

169
00:14:05,337 --> 00:14:10,050
But you made regular requests
for information from his unit CO.

170
00:14:11,426 --> 00:14:13,386
Until six months ago,
and then you stopped.

171
00:14:16,222 --> 00:14:18,767
Why was that

172
00:14:19,184 --> 00:14:20,310
Time to move on?

173
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:23,980
It's not easy to move on.

174
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:26,900
I didn't.

175
00:14:34,407 --> 00:14:37,327
I'm done answering questions.
It's your turn.

176
00:14:38,995 --> 00:14:40,413
Your husband's here.

177
00:14:42,457 --> 00:14:43,750
He's extremely ill.

178
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:46,669
Multiple organ failure.

179
00:14:48,421 --> 00:14:49,923
Massive internal bleeding.

180
00:14:50,965 --> 00:14:54,594
He must have been exposed
to some sort of radiation,

181
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:56,846
some kind of virus.

182
00:14:57,472 --> 00:14:59,891
You have to tell me where he was,
what he was doing.

183
00:15:03,061 --> 00:15:04,854
I could actually help him.

184
00:15:49,524 --> 00:15:50,984
<i>A religious event.</i>

185
00:15:51,943 --> 00:15:54,070
<i>An extraterrestrial event.</i>

186
00:15:55,155 --> 00:15:56,656
<i>A higher dimension.</i>

187
00:15:57,449 --> 00:15:59,159
We have many theories,

188
00:15:59,576 --> 00:16:00,743
few facts.

189
00:16:01,786 --> 00:16:03,955
It started around three years ago.

190
00:16:04,456 --> 00:16:08,042
Blackwater National Park reported
that a lighthouse was surrounded

191
00:16:08,126 --> 00:16:10,795
by something they termed "a shimmer."

192
00:16:11,463 --> 00:16:15,008
One of the wardens went in to investigate.

193
00:16:16,259 --> 00:16:17,093
Never returned.

194
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:19,888
The event was classified.

195
00:16:20,305 --> 00:16:22,932
Since then, we've approached by land,
by sea,

196
00:16:23,016 --> 00:16:26,394
sent in drones, animals,
and teams of people.

197
00:16:27,395 --> 00:16:28,938
But nothing comes back.

198
00:16:29,898 --> 00:16:32,442
And the boundary's getting bigger.
It's expanding.

199
00:16:32,734 --> 00:16:35,236
So far, it's eating
into barely populated swampland,

200
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:39,782
which, you know, we evacuated
under the pretext of a chemical spill,

201
00:16:39,866 --> 00:16:42,535
but... that won't last much longer.

202
00:16:43,411 --> 00:16:48,333
In a few months, the area will have grown
to where we are right now.

203
00:16:50,877 --> 00:16:53,630
And then we're talking cities...

204
00:16:54,464 --> 00:16:55,673
states... and so on.

205
00:17:00,929 --> 00:17:02,680
You said nothing comes back.

206
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:05,350
But something has.

207
00:17:07,435 --> 00:17:08,269
Yes.

208
00:17:17,111 --> 00:17:18,071
He's dying.

209
00:17:20,114 --> 00:17:20,949
Yes.

210
00:17:24,202 --> 00:17:27,580
We need to come to an agreement
about what to do with you.

211
00:17:27,956 --> 00:17:29,707
You're not going to let me go home?

212
00:17:33,586 --> 00:17:36,047
Is that what you want

213
00:17:40,301 --> 00:17:41,135
No.

214
00:17:42,053 --> 00:17:43,805
I want to be with him.

215
00:18:02,824 --> 00:18:04,325
You're not talking to me.

216
00:18:06,369 --> 00:18:07,328
Sorry.

217
00:18:08,997 --> 00:18:09,998
Zoned out.

218
00:18:11,749 --> 00:18:13,376
Thinking about the next mission?

219
00:18:16,129 --> 00:18:16,963
No.

220
00:18:18,172 --> 00:18:19,757
I was just looking at the moon.

221
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:25,263
It's always so weird seeing it like that
in the daylight.

222
00:18:25,847 --> 00:18:27,307
Like God made a mistake.

223
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:29,267
-Left the hall lights on.

224
00:18:29,517 --> 00:18:31,352
God doesn't make mistakes. That's...

225
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:34,355
somewhat key
to the whole "being a god" thing.

226
00:18:36,524 --> 00:18:37,692
Pretty sure he does.

227
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:41,237
You know he's listening right now,
don't you?

228
00:18:42,947 --> 00:18:44,157
You take a cell,

229
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,909
circumvent the Hayflick limit,
you can prevent senescence.

230
00:18:48,453 --> 00:18:50,663
I was about to make the exact same point.

231
00:18:50,747 --> 00:18:53,791
It means the cell doesn't grow old,
it becomes immortal.

232
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:55,084
Keeps dividing, doesn't die.

233
00:18:58,212 --> 00:19:02,425
They say aging is a natural process,
but it's actually a fault in our genes.

234
00:19:04,677 --> 00:19:07,138
I get really turned on
when you patronize me. It's really hot.

235
00:19:07,221 --> 00:19:10,141
Without it,
I could keep looking like this forever.

236
00:19:10,224 --> 00:19:11,351
Oh, okay.

237
00:19:11,434 --> 00:19:13,728
-Well, that could constitute a mistake.

238
00:19:19,776 --> 00:19:21,986
You didn't tell me
where you're heading this time.

239
00:19:23,946 --> 00:19:27,075
I know there's something strange
about this mission.

240
00:19:30,578 --> 00:19:31,663
Why?

241
00:19:33,164 --> 00:19:36,334
The silence around it
is louder than usual.

242
00:19:38,711 --> 00:19:41,422
Kind of angling for a clue here.

243
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,761
So...?

244
00:19:51,307 --> 00:19:52,850
We'll be under the same hemisphere.

245
00:19:55,144 --> 00:19:56,270
What does that tell me?

246
00:19:58,314 --> 00:20:01,150
It tells you that if you step outside
and you look up...

247
00:20:02,985 --> 00:20:04,487
we'll be looking at the same stars.

248
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:06,989
-Holy fucking shit.

249
00:20:08,783 --> 00:20:10,785
You think that's what I do
while you're away?

250
00:20:11,869 --> 00:20:14,539
-You think I'm out in the garden,

251
00:20:14,622 --> 00:20:16,332
pining, looking up at the sky?

252
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:21,295
Shut up. All right.
-Oh, to think my beloved Kane...

253
00:20:21,379 --> 00:20:24,882
-Okay. Uh-huh.
-...is looking at the selfsame moon.

254
00:20:25,341 --> 00:20:26,467
Stop it.

255
00:20:26,551 --> 00:20:30,054
Oh,
my distant celestial friend...

256
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:32,265
No. No.

257
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:34,892
...please care for my brave soldier.

258
00:20:34,976 --> 00:20:36,894
Jesus. You know what?
You are disrespectful,

259
00:20:36,978 --> 00:20:39,689
seriously, not only to your former
comrades in the armed forces,

260
00:20:39,772 --> 00:20:41,899
-but also to the president.
-You forgot the flag.

261
00:20:41,983 --> 00:20:44,777
Oh, I'm getting--
I'm getting to the motherfucking flag.

262
00:20:44,861 --> 00:20:45,903
Oh, my hero.

263
00:20:45,987 --> 00:20:47,697
-Screw you.
-Okay.

264
00:20:58,082 --> 00:21:01,294
She's all by herself.
Don't you think we should make friends?

265
00:21:01,377 --> 00:21:04,213
Well, obviously <i>you </i>should.
 Yep, I'll do it.

266
00:21:08,134 --> 00:21:08,968
Hey. Hey.

267
00:21:10,762 --> 00:21:13,139
-No, not at all.

268
00:21:14,348 --> 00:21:16,225
Cool. Phew.

269
00:21:16,309 --> 00:21:18,728
You know, I always see you here alone.
It's...

270
00:21:20,146 --> 00:21:24,066
I'm guessing you probably feel weird
or awkward.

271
00:21:25,693 --> 00:21:27,153
Somewhat, I guess.

272
00:21:28,279 --> 00:21:30,990
Don't. Seriously, don't.

273
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,577
The people here put themselves to sleep
in the fetal position

274
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:35,953
making cooing noises.

275
00:21:36,829 --> 00:21:38,664
It's freaky, you know.

276
00:21:40,124 --> 00:21:42,168
-I'm Anya.
-Lena.

277
00:21:42,668 --> 00:21:44,462
-Nice to meet you.
-You, too.

278
00:21:44,587 --> 00:21:47,673
Um, why don't you come and meet my crew?

279
00:21:47,882 --> 00:21:49,550
Come make friends. Come on.

280
00:21:51,385 --> 00:21:53,679
Ladies, meet Lena.

281
00:21:53,888 --> 00:21:55,765
Hi nice to meet you.

282
00:21:55,848 --> 00:21:58,684
Yeah, that's Cassie Sheppard,
and Josie Radek.

283
00:21:58,768 --> 00:22:00,478
Hi. Nice to meet you.
-Hi.

284
00:22:00,561 --> 00:22:03,272
Do you want to have a seat?
-Thank you.

285
00:22:03,397 --> 00:22:06,651
-So, first day at the Southern Reach.
-Yes.

286
00:22:06,984 --> 00:22:08,236
-Ah!

287
00:22:08,361 --> 00:22:09,779
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

288
00:22:10,822 --> 00:22:12,031
You all been here long?

289
00:22:12,907 --> 00:22:15,034
Um, yeah, right from the start.

290
00:22:15,117 --> 00:22:16,577
I'm a geomorphologist.

291
00:22:16,661 --> 00:22:19,747
I've been testing the magnetic fields
around the boundary,

292
00:22:19,831 --> 00:22:23,125
which is like using confetti
to test a hurricane.

293
00:22:23,668 --> 00:22:27,380
Uh, and I've been here... ten months.

294
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:29,090
Wow, ten months.

295
00:22:29,173 --> 00:22:30,633
Paramedic from Chicago.

296
00:22:30,716 --> 00:22:32,802
Tried to join an NGO,
but my application<i> </i>got flagged,

297
00:22:32,885 --> 00:22:34,136
so Southern Reach got me.

298
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:36,681
Only two months. I'm a physicist.

299
00:22:36,764 --> 00:22:39,225
I came straight from my Cambridge postdoc.

300
00:22:39,892 --> 00:22:41,310
She's very smart.

301
00:22:42,019 --> 00:22:43,688
What's your story, Lena?

302
00:22:43,813 --> 00:22:46,232
Uh, I'm from Johns Hopkins, biologist.

303
00:22:46,315 --> 00:22:47,984
-Oh, there you go.

304
00:22:48,067 --> 00:22:49,610
-Told you she was smart.
 What?

305
00:22:49,694 --> 00:22:52,947
We had a bet on your profession,
and Josie had biologist, of course.

306
00:22:55,575 --> 00:22:57,994
-I had law enforcement.
-I had you as single.

307
00:22:58,077 --> 00:23:00,746
Jesus. Do you have to hit
on everyone, like all the time?

308
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:02,415
Fuck that. Under the circumstances,

309
00:23:02,498 --> 00:23:05,418
I think I'm allowed to roll the dice
a few more times.

310
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,461
Under what circumstances?

311
00:23:10,381 --> 00:23:13,384
Well, yeah, um, crazy as it seems...

312
00:23:13,718 --> 00:23:15,553
Crazy as it <i>is.</i>

313
00:23:18,264 --> 00:23:19,974
...we are headed that way.

314
00:23:25,229 --> 00:23:27,857
-Six days and counting.

315
00:23:29,942 --> 00:23:31,569
-Four.

316
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,154
Ventress.

317
00:23:34,864 --> 00:23:37,575
Mmm. Team leader.

318
00:23:38,951 --> 00:23:40,828
-All women.
-Scientists.

319
00:23:40,912 --> 00:23:44,457
The previous teams
have been largely military, so, yeah.

320
00:23:45,875 --> 00:23:47,251
What do you think happened to them?

321
00:23:47,877 --> 00:23:51,047
Well, there are two theories
of what went wrong in the Shimmer.

322
00:23:51,672 --> 00:23:53,674
One, something kills them.

323
00:23:53,758 --> 00:23:56,344
Two, they go crazy and kill each other.

324
00:23:58,095 --> 00:24:00,348
There was one military guy
who made it out.

325
00:24:00,431 --> 00:24:01,265
Yeah. A sergeant.

326
00:24:02,767 --> 00:24:04,977
Yeah, but you heard
about the state that he was in.

327
00:24:53,192 --> 00:24:54,193
Kane...

328
00:24:57,154 --> 00:24:59,031
I know why you went in.

329
00:25:08,207 --> 00:25:09,583
I am so sorry.

330
00:25:12,336 --> 00:25:14,338
And I know what I have to do.

331
00:25:18,259 --> 00:25:21,512
<i>So you didn't tell them</i>
<i>about your connection to Sergeant Kane?</i>

332
00:25:21,929 --> 00:25:24,598
I thought it would complicate things.

333
00:25:25,683 --> 00:25:26,517
What?

334
00:25:27,685 --> 00:25:28,936
What would it complicate?

335
00:25:35,735 --> 00:25:37,987
Why are you going into the Shimmer?

336
00:25:40,031 --> 00:25:44,618
The mission statement is to reach
the supposed source of the Shimmer,

337
00:25:44,702 --> 00:25:49,373
the lighthouse,
enter and acquire data, and return.

338
00:25:51,208 --> 00:25:54,378
But I don't think that
that's your mission statement.

339
00:25:59,675 --> 00:26:00,509
No.

340
00:26:08,976 --> 00:26:12,146
I've been watching the phenomenon
for a while now.

341
00:26:13,105 --> 00:26:15,733
I profile the volunteers.

342
00:26:16,692 --> 00:26:18,944
I pick the teams.

343
00:26:20,863 --> 00:26:23,991
They enter, I watch.

344
00:26:26,452 --> 00:26:28,496
I watch it grow closer.

345
00:26:31,749 --> 00:26:33,709
There's only so long one can do that.

346
00:26:35,878 --> 00:26:37,630
But you need to know what's inside?

347
00:26:39,465 --> 00:26:41,550
Yes, I do.

348
00:26:44,345 --> 00:26:45,596
So do I.

349
00:26:46,764 --> 00:26:48,599
So that's the complication.

350
00:26:50,226 --> 00:26:51,602
You want to come with us.

351
00:26:52,978 --> 00:26:55,064
I can't do anything for him here.

352
00:26:56,816 --> 00:26:58,484
Soldier-scientist.

353
00:26:59,652 --> 00:27:01,195
You can fight.

354
00:27:02,238 --> 00:27:03,447
You can learn.

355
00:27:05,991 --> 00:27:07,284
You can save him.

356
00:27:13,624 --> 00:27:15,751
You requested to join the mission.

357
00:27:16,293 --> 00:27:18,379
You knew all other missions had failed

358
00:27:18,462 --> 00:27:20,965
and the only survivor
was barely surviving.

359
00:27:22,174 --> 00:27:23,384
That was a brave choice.

360
00:27:24,593 --> 00:27:25,427
I owed him.

361
00:27:28,013 --> 00:27:30,391
I'm only trying to understand
what drove you.

362
00:27:33,727 --> 00:27:34,854
I owed him...

363
00:27:37,731 --> 00:27:38,607
so I went in.

364
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,399
And then we get some real meals.

365
00:30:26,191 --> 00:30:29,278
Spaghetti.
Here's Radek's vegetable crackers.

366
00:30:31,655 --> 00:30:33,741
Wow, cornbread. That's not so bad.

367
00:30:34,241 --> 00:30:35,534
Oh, you're finally awake.

368
00:30:36,285 --> 00:30:39,330
You gotta give me a second.
I'm a little disoriented.

369
00:30:39,788 --> 00:30:41,081
Join the club.

370
00:30:41,582 --> 00:30:43,709
You don't remember
setting up camp, do you?

371
00:30:45,836 --> 00:30:49,631
I don't remember anything...
after we reached the tree line.

372
00:30:50,966 --> 00:30:51,800
None of us do.

373
00:30:52,885 --> 00:30:54,428
And we did a food inventory.

374
00:30:54,511 --> 00:30:59,433
From the depletion, we've been out here
for at least three or four days.

375
00:31:01,143 --> 00:31:01,977
That's not possible.

376
00:31:02,686 --> 00:31:03,937
That's what I said.

377
00:31:06,106 --> 00:31:10,694
Guys, I've been checking
my comms and nav equipment.

378
00:31:10,986 --> 00:31:13,113
They boot up fine,
no problem with the electronics,

379
00:31:13,197 --> 00:31:14,615
and the camera is working,

380
00:31:14,698 --> 00:31:18,577
but anything that sends a signal
out of the Shimmer... is down.

381
00:31:19,286 --> 00:31:22,164
Even though we've probably got
about 20 satellites above us right now,

382
00:31:22,247 --> 00:31:24,458
and... check this out.

383
00:31:27,586 --> 00:31:31,965
So we've got no compass,
no comms, no coordinates...

384
00:31:32,883 --> 00:31:33,967
and no landmarks.

385
00:31:34,051 --> 00:31:35,928
Well, we know we're in the state park.

386
00:31:36,011 --> 00:31:37,388
We head south, we hit the ocean,

387
00:31:37,471 --> 00:31:41,350
then we can just follow the shoreline
until we hit the perimeter wall. Right?

388
00:31:42,476 --> 00:31:45,521
-Come on, Josie, you know this.

389
00:31:45,896 --> 00:31:47,231
Hour hand at the sun.

390
00:31:48,607 --> 00:31:51,193
Split the difference
between the hour hand and 12, south.

391
00:31:52,319 --> 00:31:53,278
Good.

392
00:31:53,529 --> 00:31:54,655
We're oriented.

393
00:31:55,406 --> 00:31:58,659
We weren't really expecting
the comms equipment to work, were we?

394
00:31:58,992 --> 00:32:02,621
There's been three years of expeditions
and three years of radio silence.

395
00:32:03,622 --> 00:32:05,707
Let's pack up and get moving.

396
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:08,085
We've already lost a lot of the day.

397
00:33:09,021 --> 00:33:11,815
Oh, I'm gonna check this out.
Get us out of this damn swamp.

398
00:33:11,899 --> 00:33:14,985
All right.
Let's check out the hut.

399
00:33:33,629 --> 00:33:35,923
Looks like someone's
about to have a wedding. These are very strange.

400
00:33:41,762 --> 00:33:42,596
Why?

401
00:33:44,723 --> 00:33:46,350
Well, they're all so different.

402
00:33:46,808 --> 00:33:50,270
To look at them, you wouldn't say
that they're the same species.

403
00:33:51,522 --> 00:33:53,690
But they're growing
from the same branch structure...

404
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,985
so it has to be the same species.

405
00:33:57,653 --> 00:33:59,112
It's the same plant.

406
00:34:00,364 --> 00:34:02,824
It's like they're stuck
in a continuous mutation.

407
00:34:03,075 --> 00:34:04,159
A pathology?

408
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:06,370
Yeah, well...

409
00:34:08,247 --> 00:34:11,583
you'd sure as hell call it a pathology
if you saw this in a human.

410
00:34:22,427 --> 00:34:24,346
Jackpot.

411
00:34:24,638 --> 00:34:27,224
Sheppard! Mode of transportation.

412
00:34:32,437 --> 00:34:33,855
Anything interesting in there?

413
00:34:34,273 --> 00:34:36,984
No. It's been long abandoned,
maybe even before--

414
00:34:38,652 --> 00:34:39,528
Radek?

415
00:34:40,696 --> 00:34:41,989
Radek!

416
00:34:42,573 --> 00:34:43,907
-Radek!

417
00:34:43,991 --> 00:34:45,200
It's got my bag!

418
00:34:45,284 --> 00:34:46,535
Radek!

419
00:34:49,246 --> 00:34:51,748
Something's got my bag!

420
00:34:51,999 --> 00:34:53,458
Oh, no!

421
00:34:54,167 --> 00:34:55,168
It's got my bag!

422
00:35:00,048 --> 00:35:02,301
Help me with her!
 What's going on?

423
00:35:03,885 --> 00:35:05,345
Hey, grab my shoulder!

424
00:35:08,557 --> 00:35:09,975
Get her. Come on.

425
00:35:11,476 --> 00:35:12,561
I got her.

426
00:35:12,769 --> 00:35:14,313
Okay

427
00:35:14,396 --> 00:35:15,772
I got her. Okay.

428
00:35:15,856 --> 00:35:16,898
You're good, you're good.

429
00:35:18,025 --> 00:35:18,859
It's okay.

430
00:35:25,699 --> 00:35:28,160
Let's sit you down.
Help me with her bag.

431
00:35:28,243 --> 00:35:30,621
Okay, just breathe.
It's okay. You're just fine.

432
00:35:30,704 --> 00:35:32,956
-Something in the water.

433
00:35:44,426 --> 00:35:46,261
-Get up, get up. Go.

434
00:35:56,104 --> 00:35:57,814
Oh, shit! Get back.

435
00:36:02,527 --> 00:36:05,322
Sheppard! Sheppard, watch out!

436
00:36:08,784 --> 00:36:10,535
-Holy fuck!

437
00:36:52,119 --> 00:36:52,953
Whoa.

438
00:36:54,913 --> 00:36:57,165
It's exactly the same as the flowers.

439
00:36:58,500 --> 00:36:59,626
Look at the teeth.

440
00:37:01,044 --> 00:37:02,671
Concentric rows.

441
00:37:03,505 --> 00:37:06,425
Something here is making giant waves
in the gene pool.

442
00:37:07,008 --> 00:37:08,552
Sharks have teeth like that, don't they?

443
00:37:08,635 --> 00:37:10,637
Do you think it's a crossbreed?

444
00:37:12,013 --> 00:37:15,100
You can't crossbreed
between different species.

445
00:37:18,729 --> 00:37:20,397
Lena, this is getting heavy.

446
00:37:29,948 --> 00:37:32,492
The mutations were subtle at first.

447
00:37:33,702 --> 00:37:36,997
More extreme as we grew closer
to the lighthouse.

448
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:40,542
Corruptions of form.

449
00:37:41,835 --> 00:37:43,670
Duplicates of form.

450
00:37:43,754 --> 00:37:44,755
Duplicates?

451
00:37:48,341 --> 00:37:49,259
Echoes.

452
00:37:53,764 --> 00:37:56,099
Is it possible these were hallucinations?

453
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,562
I wondered that myself.

454
00:38:01,897 --> 00:38:04,107
But they were shared among all of us.

455
00:38:06,443 --> 00:38:08,153
It was dreamlike.

456
00:38:09,738 --> 00:38:10,655
Nightmarish.

457
00:38:11,615 --> 00:38:12,657
Not always.

458
00:38:15,035 --> 00:38:17,120
Sometimes it was beautiful.

459
00:38:41,311 --> 00:38:43,438
Ow.

460
00:38:45,524 --> 00:38:46,483
You hurt?

461
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:48,693
It's just a bruise.

462
00:38:49,486 --> 00:38:52,280
Must have gotten that from the gator.

463
00:38:52,781 --> 00:38:53,615
Yeah.

464
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:00,664
So, where'd you learn to shoot?

465
00:39:02,916 --> 00:39:05,335
I was in the military
before I was an academic.

466
00:39:06,503 --> 00:39:07,337
Marines?

467
00:39:07,796 --> 00:39:09,422
Army. Seven years.

468
00:39:10,131 --> 00:39:12,175
Feels like a lifetime ago now.

469
00:39:12,425 --> 00:39:13,260
Yeah.

470
00:39:14,886 --> 00:39:17,305
All other lives feel like a lifetime ago.

471
00:39:17,889 --> 00:39:19,933
We were kids, I was married.

472
00:39:21,309 --> 00:39:24,729
Which do you carry around your neck?
A husband or a child?

473
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:26,147
Husband.

474
00:39:27,691 --> 00:39:29,693
He was in the army, too. That's...

475
00:39:30,443 --> 00:39:31,528
That's how we met.

476
00:39:32,779 --> 00:39:34,072
"Was" in the army

477
00:39:35,824 --> 00:39:36,783
KIA.

478
00:39:38,952 --> 00:39:40,120
I'm sorry to hear that.

479
00:39:41,872 --> 00:39:43,498
Guess there had to be something.

480
00:39:44,124 --> 00:39:45,000
What do you mean?

481
00:39:47,627 --> 00:39:50,130
Volunteering for... this.

482
00:39:50,213 --> 00:39:53,884
It's not exactly something you do
if your life is in... perfect harmony.

483
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,471
We're all damaged goods here.

484
00:39:59,431 --> 00:40:00,557
Anya is sober...

485
00:40:01,349 --> 00:40:02,559
therefore an addict.

486
00:40:02,976 --> 00:40:05,020
Josie wears long sleeves

487
00:40:05,103 --> 00:40:07,814
'cause she doesn't want you
to see the scars on her forearms.

488
00:40:07,898 --> 00:40:09,566
She's tried to kill herself?

489
00:40:10,191 --> 00:40:12,986
No, I think the opposite,
trying to feel alive.

490
00:40:16,156 --> 00:40:16,990
Ventress?

491
00:40:18,158 --> 00:40:20,744
Yeah. As far as anyone knows...

492
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:25,582
no friends, no family,
no partner, no children.

493
00:40:26,708 --> 00:40:28,501
No concession in her at all.

494
00:40:31,671 --> 00:40:34,591
-I also lost someone.

495
00:40:37,427 --> 00:40:39,012
Not a husband, though, um...

496
00:40:39,429 --> 00:40:41,681
A daughter. Leukemia.

497
00:40:42,933 --> 00:40:44,059
God, I'm sorry.

498
00:40:44,809 --> 00:40:46,478
In a way, it's two bereavements.

499
00:40:48,730 --> 00:40:51,149
My... beautiful girl...

500
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,694
and the person I once was.

501
00:40:54,778 --> 00:40:56,029
Hey, hey!

502
00:40:56,947 --> 00:40:58,323
We got something here.

503
00:41:29,854 --> 00:41:32,607
This used to be the headquarters
of the Southern Reach.

504
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:35,443
Before the Shimmer swallowed it.

505
00:41:39,114 --> 00:41:40,365
More mutations.

506
00:41:41,491 --> 00:41:42,617
They're everywhere.

507
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:44,703
Malignant.

508
00:41:45,495 --> 00:41:46,955
Like tumors.

509
00:41:48,832 --> 00:41:50,375
Is that the old mess hall?

510
00:41:50,583 --> 00:41:51,418
Yeah.

511
00:41:51,626 --> 00:41:53,962
Let's billet there. Come on.

512
00:42:29,497 --> 00:42:32,375
There's beds and bags.
You think people are here?

513
00:42:33,543 --> 00:42:34,544
Were here.

514
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:37,630
Yeah, I'm gonna go with the past tense.

515
00:42:58,401 --> 00:42:59,235
Damn.

516
00:43:03,073 --> 00:43:03,990
Oh.

517
00:43:05,658 --> 00:43:06,951
Oh, shit.

518
00:43:16,711 --> 00:43:18,963
This shit is heavy. Can't carry this.

519
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:37,148
Lena, what you got going on?

520
00:43:39,317 --> 00:43:40,568
Guys, check this out.

521
00:43:42,821 --> 00:43:44,989
"Peyton, Mayer...

522
00:43:46,950 --> 00:43:49,285
Kane, Shelley."

523
00:43:49,869 --> 00:43:52,038
Those were the soldiers
on the last expedition.

524
00:43:52,413 --> 00:43:55,250
Looks like they were using this room
as their base of operations.

525
00:43:55,333 --> 00:43:57,127
Why are some of the names crossed out?

526
00:43:57,210 --> 00:43:58,837
Let's not jump to conclusions.

527
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:01,172
-I don't know, maybe we should.
-Yeah.

528
00:44:01,798 --> 00:44:05,176
Yep. This is the mess hall.

529
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:06,594
Yep.

530
00:44:06,678 --> 00:44:09,722
I think that the times by the names
are a guard rota, so...

531
00:44:10,431 --> 00:44:12,183
if they were guarding the perimeter,
we should.

532
00:44:12,267 --> 00:44:13,935
Copy that.
 Yep.

533
00:44:27,031 --> 00:44:29,367
This might be able to tell us something.

534
00:44:32,996 --> 00:44:34,914
"For those that follow."

535
00:44:36,291 --> 00:44:38,793
I believe that means us.

536
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:48,803
Memory card.

537
00:44:51,556 --> 00:44:53,349
I should be able to play this.

538
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:02,150
It's working.

539
00:45:06,988 --> 00:45:08,114
<i>All right?</i>

540
00:45:13,161 --> 00:45:14,913
<i></i>
<i>-Okay.</i>

541
00:45:15,371 --> 00:45:16,206
<i>Okay.</i>

542
00:45:26,424 --> 00:45:28,468
<i>Okay. Okay. Okay.</i> <i>Okay.</i>

543
00:45:28,551 --> 00:45:30,303
<i>Okay. Okay.</i>
 <i>Yeah?</i>

544
00:45:30,386 --> 00:45:31,804
<i>Okay.</i>

545
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:46,361
Shit.

546
00:45:47,403 --> 00:45:48,571
What is he doing?

547
00:45:56,746 --> 00:45:59,290
<i>Stop. Stop. Stop, stop, stop.</i>

548
00:46:00,792 --> 00:46:02,460
<i>Hold him. Hold him down.</i>

549
00:46:04,545 --> 00:46:06,339
<i>Oh, yeah. Yeah.</i>

550
00:46:06,422 --> 00:46:07,757
<i>There. There.</i>

551
00:46:24,482 --> 00:46:27,694
Okay, so we know what happened
to the last group. They went insane.

552
00:46:28,611 --> 00:46:30,655
-Was something alive inside that man.
-No.

553
00:46:30,738 --> 00:46:32,824
-That was a trick of the light.
 What?

554
00:46:32,907 --> 00:46:35,868
I've been a paramedic for 10 years.
I've scraped people off the road.

555
00:46:35,952 --> 00:46:38,830
You see some weird shit.
That was a trick of the light.

556
00:46:38,913 --> 00:46:41,457
His insides were moving.
 No, it was shock.

557
00:46:41,541 --> 00:46:43,668
-That was a shock response.
 Watch it again.

558
00:46:43,751 --> 00:46:45,503
No, I'm not gonna watch it again!

559
00:46:45,586 --> 00:46:47,547
That was not intestines.
It was a worm--

560
00:46:47,630 --> 00:46:49,716
Okay, then you watch it, Sheppard!

561
00:46:54,012 --> 00:46:55,138
Where are you going?

562
00:47:09,402 --> 00:47:11,112
-Just ahead.

563
00:48:08,086 --> 00:48:08,920
What is it?

564
00:48:10,254 --> 00:48:11,381
I don't know.

565
00:48:29,315 --> 00:48:31,901
-I don't want to stay here tonight.
-We don't have a choice.

566
00:48:34,112 --> 00:48:35,738
Please.
-Come on.

567
00:48:35,822 --> 00:48:38,699
It's too late in the day
for us to move on.

568
00:48:39,033 --> 00:48:40,535
Come on, let's go outside.

569
00:49:22,243 --> 00:49:24,370
Oh, that's nice of you.

570
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:28,833
Why aren't you here?

571
00:49:31,085 --> 00:49:32,628
I gotta leave a day early.

572
00:49:33,379 --> 00:49:34,255
What?

573
00:49:35,631 --> 00:49:36,883
Wait, today?

574
00:49:38,509 --> 00:49:40,720
-Right now.
-Oh, shit.

575
00:49:41,095 --> 00:49:42,638
But we had a whole day planned.

576
00:49:42,722 --> 00:49:44,765
-We were gonna drive to the country--
-No, we can't.

577
00:49:45,683 --> 00:49:47,685
-We can't.

578
00:49:53,483 --> 00:49:54,609
Now means right now.

579
00:49:58,446 --> 00:49:59,280
Yeah.

580
00:50:02,825 --> 00:50:03,743
What is it?

581
00:50:11,167 --> 00:50:12,084
I do...

582
00:50:16,130 --> 00:50:17,006
love you...

583
00:50:18,174 --> 00:50:19,091
Lena.

584
00:50:21,552 --> 00:50:22,512
I love you, too.

585
00:51:19,902 --> 00:51:20,987
Hey.

586
00:51:23,030 --> 00:51:24,198
The mystery unraveling?

587
00:51:26,284 --> 00:51:27,952
Something's unraveling.

588
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:30,621
I think you're doing okay.

589
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:34,542
It's good Josie's getting some rest.

590
00:51:34,625 --> 00:51:35,459
Yeah.

591
00:51:35,835 --> 00:51:37,712
With the help of a little sedative.

592
00:51:37,795 --> 00:51:40,214
How about you

593
00:51:41,090 --> 00:51:41,924
Some.

594
00:51:43,050 --> 00:51:45,136
I'm at least as freaked as Josie.

595
00:51:46,846 --> 00:51:48,472
I'm just hiding it better.

596
00:51:52,393 --> 00:51:53,603
I should check on Ventress.

597
00:51:55,479 --> 00:51:56,314
Yep.

598
00:52:28,304 --> 00:52:30,723
What're you doing up?
Not supposed to relieve me until 3:00.

599
00:52:30,806 --> 00:52:32,725
I'm done sleeping for the night.

600
00:52:33,392 --> 00:52:34,226
Okay.

601
00:52:36,145 --> 00:52:37,229
Come look at this.

602
00:52:40,775 --> 00:52:42,109
Okay, this is where we are...

603
00:52:43,819 --> 00:52:45,237
and that's the lighthouse.

604
00:52:45,571 --> 00:52:47,657
Southwest is Ville Perdu.

605
00:52:47,740 --> 00:52:50,451
It's a small community we evacuated
two years ago.

606
00:52:51,077 --> 00:52:53,746
I think we should head there tomorrow,

607
00:52:54,413 --> 00:52:57,166
and then head out for the coast
the following morning.

608
00:53:00,628 --> 00:53:01,462
Good.

609
00:53:06,926 --> 00:53:07,927
You okay?

610
00:53:14,141 --> 00:53:15,643
I was gonna say, when...

611
00:53:16,435 --> 00:53:18,813
you didn't tell the team
about your connection to Kane,

612
00:53:18,896 --> 00:53:20,856
I wasn't sure if that was a good idea.

613
00:53:23,401 --> 00:53:25,444
But after seeing that footage...

614
00:53:28,698 --> 00:53:29,532
yeah.

615
00:53:30,449 --> 00:53:32,868
I'm not sure how they would have reacted
to you.

616
00:53:35,746 --> 00:53:37,915
Why did my husband volunteer
for a suicide mission?

617
00:53:38,624 --> 00:53:40,292
Is that what you think we're doing?

618
00:53:41,127 --> 00:53:43,295
-You must have profiled him,

619
00:53:43,379 --> 00:53:44,755
you must have assessed him.

620
00:53:46,132 --> 00:53:47,675
He must have said something.

621
00:53:49,176 --> 00:53:51,387
So you're asking me as a psychologist.

622
00:53:53,180 --> 00:53:54,014
Yeah.

623
00:53:55,433 --> 00:53:57,184
Then, as a psychologist...

624
00:53:58,185 --> 00:54:01,772
I'd say you're confusing suicide
with self-destruction.

625
00:54:04,275 --> 00:54:06,527
Almost none of us commit suicide...

626
00:54:07,403 --> 00:54:09,572
and almost all of us self-destruct.

627
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:12,450
In some way, in some part of our lives.

628
00:54:13,784 --> 00:54:16,412
We drink, or we smoke.

629
00:54:16,871 --> 00:54:18,998
We destabilize the good job.

630
00:54:21,375 --> 00:54:22,668
Or the happy marriage.

631
00:54:27,965 --> 00:54:29,967
These aren't decisions, they're...

632
00:54:30,885 --> 00:54:32,052
They're impulses.

633
00:54:32,428 --> 00:54:37,433
In fact, you're probably better equipped
to explain this than I am.

634
00:54:39,477 --> 00:54:40,728
You're a biologist.

635
00:54:42,104 --> 00:54:44,523
Isn't self

636
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:46,400
Programmed into each cell?

637
00:54:49,361 --> 00:54:50,362
What was that?

638
00:54:50,446 --> 00:54:51,947
-Don't know.

639
00:55:03,876 --> 00:55:04,794
Josie, wake up.

640
00:55:05,044 --> 00:55:07,254
Wake up, Josie, come on.
Wake up. Something's happening.

641
00:55:07,713 --> 00:55:09,507
-No.

642
00:55:10,007 --> 00:55:11,592
What happened? I heard a noise.

643
00:55:13,052 --> 00:55:14,303
Oh.
 What?

644
00:55:17,139 --> 00:55:18,516
Something's come through the fence.

645
00:55:19,642 --> 00:55:22,269
-It's ripped open like a fucking zipper.

646
00:55:27,858 --> 00:55:28,692
Can't see.

647
00:55:28,776 --> 00:55:30,277
-Yeah, neither can I.

648
00:55:32,571 --> 00:55:33,614
Sheppard!

649
00:55:33,697 --> 00:55:35,324
Sheppard!

650
00:55:35,407 --> 00:55:37,368
-Fuck!

651
00:55:37,451 --> 00:55:39,328
Sheppard was next to me.
Something took her.

652
00:55:40,412 --> 00:55:43,415
-Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck! Sheppard!

653
00:55:43,499 --> 00:55:44,333
Oh, shit!

654
00:55:44,416 --> 00:55:48,045
Help! Help me!

655
00:55:51,507 --> 00:55:52,716
Shepp... Sheppard!

656
00:56:01,851 --> 00:56:02,977
Sheppard!

657
00:56:32,673 --> 00:56:33,716
We have to go back.

658
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:36,552
-We have to go back now.
 She's right.

659
00:56:36,802 --> 00:56:38,554
Right

660
00:56:38,637 --> 00:56:40,097
We've been attacked twice.

661
00:56:40,347 --> 00:56:42,224
We lost one of our own.

662
00:56:42,308 --> 00:56:45,436
We have evidence the previous team
went nuts and chopped each other up.

663
00:56:45,519 --> 00:56:47,938
I really don't know how much more right
she has to be.

664
00:56:48,022 --> 00:56:49,648
We haven't reached the lighthouse.

665
00:56:49,732 --> 00:56:52,651
We still don't understand the cause
or the nature of the Shimmer.

666
00:56:52,735 --> 00:56:55,195
We have data, observations, photographs.
She has hella footage.

667
00:56:55,279 --> 00:56:58,991
All of which makes the phenomenon
less explicable, not more.

668
00:57:01,452 --> 00:57:03,245
I'm gonna get to the lighthouse,

669
00:57:03,329 --> 00:57:05,247
and I'm fine going on my own.

670
00:57:05,331 --> 00:57:09,585
You just need to decide...
whether you're coming with me or not.

671
00:57:21,722 --> 00:57:23,807
It's like she hasn't noticed
that Sheppard is dead.

672
00:57:23,891 --> 00:57:25,059
She's crazy.

673
00:57:25,267 --> 00:57:27,061
She's a crazy old bitch.

674
00:57:28,228 --> 00:57:30,773
You know,
and thanks for the fucking backup, Lena.

675
00:57:32,066 --> 00:57:34,234
-I didn't realize there were sides.
 Yeah.

676
00:57:34,610 --> 00:57:35,569
Yeah, there are sides.

677
00:57:36,862 --> 00:57:39,698
Okay, then I agree with you.
We should go back.

678
00:57:40,574 --> 00:57:42,618
Good. Okay, great. There we go. Okay?

679
00:57:42,701 --> 00:57:44,995
-So the three of us can--
 Hold on a minute.

680
00:57:45,079 --> 00:57:46,455
We should go back, yes.

681
00:57:46,538 --> 00:57:48,707
But it took us, what,
six days to get here?

682
00:57:49,083 --> 00:57:51,418
And the coast is two days away.

683
00:57:52,419 --> 00:57:54,838
And as Sheppard said...

684
00:57:55,839 --> 00:57:59,218
when we get to the coast,
we can follow it until the perimeter wall.

685
00:57:59,677 --> 00:58:01,428
You're saying we get out
by going deeper?

686
00:58:02,179 --> 00:58:04,181
-Yeah, if you like, yeah.

687
00:58:04,556 --> 00:58:07,184
No, I don't fucking "like."

688
00:58:11,647 --> 00:58:14,274
This isn't some bullshit tactic
to get us to the lighthouse, is it?

689
00:58:14,358 --> 00:58:16,694
This is not about the lighthouse, okay?

690
00:58:17,486 --> 00:58:19,530
I believe that the coast
is the best route out.

691
00:58:24,326 --> 00:58:25,160
Okay?

692
00:58:38,716 --> 00:58:39,717
You lied to them.

693
00:58:43,137 --> 00:58:45,180
I didn't know what going back meant.

694
00:58:45,889 --> 00:58:48,350
Why it would be safer than going forward.

695
00:58:49,601 --> 00:58:53,272
You didn't know, but you made
a decision to continue as if you did.

696
00:58:53,439 --> 00:58:54,773
Ventress made the decision.

697
00:58:54,857 --> 00:58:57,651
Ventress had cancer.
She was never coming back.

698
00:58:58,986 --> 00:59:00,320
You knew she was sick.

699
00:59:01,238 --> 00:59:02,156
I had guessed.

700
00:59:05,576 --> 00:59:07,202
And you wanted to continue.

701
00:59:09,455 --> 00:59:10,289
Yes. I did.

702
00:59:59,838 --> 01:00:01,381
She could still be alive.

703
01:00:01,465 --> 01:00:02,925
It's highly doubtful.

704
01:00:04,718 --> 01:00:05,761
We need to know.

705
01:00:08,847 --> 01:00:09,681
Go. Fine.

706
01:00:14,311 --> 01:00:15,187
I'm coming with you.

707
01:00:16,814 --> 01:00:17,689
I'll go alone.

708
01:02:46,922 --> 01:02:47,965
Did you find her?

709
01:02:48,799 --> 01:02:49,633
Yeah.

710
01:02:51,134 --> 01:02:51,969
She's dead.

711
01:03:16,994 --> 01:03:17,911
You okay?

712
01:03:18,912 --> 01:03:22,124
Fine. Just... leave me the fuck alone.

713
01:03:48,567 --> 01:03:50,319
We'll camp here tonight.

714
01:03:51,403 --> 01:03:53,613
It's another two hours' walk up the coast.

715
01:04:31,651 --> 01:04:33,236
They've grown this way.

716
01:04:34,279 --> 01:04:35,739
That doesn't make any sense.

717
01:04:36,573 --> 01:04:37,741
I think it does.

718
01:04:47,042 --> 01:04:50,629
At first I thought the radio waves
were blocked by the Shimmer,

719
01:04:50,712 --> 01:04:54,841
and that's why no one inside
could communicate with base or GPS,

720
01:04:54,925 --> 01:05:00,180
but the light waves aren't blocked,
they're refracted, and...

721
01:05:04,976 --> 01:05:06,770
...it's the same with the radios.

722
01:05:07,479 --> 01:05:08,980
The signals aren't gone.

723
01:05:09,564 --> 01:05:10,899
They're scrambled.

724
01:05:17,155 --> 01:05:18,657
That leaf in your hand...

725
01:05:19,866 --> 01:05:21,660
know what you'd get if you sequenced it?

726
01:05:22,577 --> 01:05:24,871
-Human Hox genes.

727
01:05:24,955 --> 01:05:26,498
Hox

728
01:05:27,374 --> 01:05:31,420
They're the genes that define
the body plan, the physical structure.

729
01:05:33,588 --> 01:05:35,715
And the plants have human body plan.

730
01:05:35,799 --> 01:05:40,262
Arms attached to shoulders. Legs to hips.

731
01:05:40,345 --> 01:05:41,972
It's literally not possible. It's literally what's happening.

732
01:05:46,476 --> 01:05:50,147
The Shimmer is a prism,
but it refracts everything.

733
01:05:50,981 --> 01:05:53,358
Not just light and radio waves.

734
01:05:53,942 --> 01:05:57,112
Animal DNA, plant DNA...

735
01:05:58,196 --> 01:05:59,531
all DNA.

736
01:06:00,031 --> 01:06:01,450
What do you mean, "all DNA"?

737
01:06:02,367 --> 01:06:04,119
She's talking about our DNA.

738
01:06:06,997 --> 01:06:08,373
She's talking about us.

739
01:07:15,023 --> 01:07:17,651
All right... I guess this is a bedroom.

740
01:07:19,194 --> 01:07:21,029
Let's secure doors and windows.

741
01:08:46,781 --> 01:08:48,491
This was a mistake.

742
01:08:50,785 --> 01:08:51,620
Okay.

743
01:08:58,418 --> 01:09:01,046
You spend more time
away from your husband than with him.

744
01:09:03,131 --> 01:09:06,384
You can't talk to him about work,
and he won't talk to you about his.

745
01:09:06,468 --> 01:09:10,472
And there is a clear physical
and intellectual connection between us.

746
01:09:10,555 --> 01:09:12,641
-You forgot your wife.

747
01:09:12,724 --> 01:09:13,933
I love my wife.

748
01:09:16,811 --> 01:09:18,229
She's blameless in this.

749
01:09:26,821 --> 01:09:27,697
Come on, Lena.

750
01:09:29,449 --> 01:09:31,076
What's really going on here?

751
01:09:33,161 --> 01:09:35,497
You think that something
may have happened to him?

752
01:09:40,543 --> 01:09:41,878
Or you think he knows.

753
01:09:44,756 --> 01:09:45,799
That's it, isn't it?

754
01:09:46,758 --> 01:09:49,386
You think somehow he's found out
about our affair.

755
01:09:51,596 --> 01:09:52,639
Has he found out?

756
01:09:53,973 --> 01:09:54,808
Yes.

757
01:09:58,561 --> 01:09:59,437
You should go.

758
01:10:01,940 --> 01:10:03,358
-No, Lena, I--
-Dan...

759
01:10:04,359 --> 01:10:08,321
I'm not interested in talking...
or in anything you have to say.

760
01:10:09,531 --> 01:10:11,032
Just get dressed and get out.

761
01:10:13,868 --> 01:10:16,538
You know, it's not me you hate,
it's yourself.

762
01:10:19,999 --> 01:10:21,459
No, Dan, it's you, too.

763
01:10:25,630 --> 01:10:27,132
It's never gonna happen again. You lying bitch!

764
01:10:36,307 --> 01:10:38,017
-No.

765
01:10:38,768 --> 01:10:41,688
You don't get to ask
that fucking question. You answer it!

766
01:11:11,217 --> 01:11:12,051
Brother. Boyfriend.

767
01:11:17,474 --> 01:11:18,308
Husband.

768
01:11:22,395 --> 01:11:23,605
Husband.

769
01:11:25,857 --> 01:11:28,818
Why didn't you tell us?

770
01:11:30,153 --> 01:11:33,281
-You knew. Obviously.

771
01:11:42,081 --> 01:11:44,000
-Okay.

772
01:11:48,713 --> 01:11:50,757
There are two theories
of what went wrong.

773
01:11:50,840 --> 01:11:52,467
One is that something in here killed them.

774
01:11:52,550 --> 01:11:56,387
Two... is that they went crazy
and they killed each other.

775
01:11:58,223 --> 01:12:00,391
Josie nearly got killed by an alligator,

776
01:12:00,475 --> 01:12:03,102
and Cass did get killed by a bear.

777
01:12:05,605 --> 01:12:07,690
So, yes, theory one, it fits.

778
01:12:10,944 --> 01:12:11,778
But...

779
01:12:14,739 --> 01:12:16,449
I didn't actually see a bear.

780
01:12:17,951 --> 01:12:19,118
And neither did Josie.

781
01:12:20,286 --> 01:12:22,413
The only people who saw
were Lena and Ventress.

782
01:12:22,956 --> 01:12:25,667
So nothing's confirmed.
Everything's on their word.

783
01:12:26,042 --> 01:12:30,380
-Everything's on Lena's word.

784
01:12:30,755 --> 01:12:32,173
And what we know now...

785
01:12:33,633 --> 01:12:36,511
what we know,

786
01:12:36,886 --> 01:12:40,139
is that Lena... is a liar.

787
01:12:40,223 --> 01:12:42,308
-Shut the fuck up!

788
01:12:43,977 --> 01:12:47,647
Lena... you're a liar.

789
01:12:50,733 --> 01:12:51,568
Did you kill Cass?

790
01:12:54,487 --> 01:12:55,864
Did you lose your shit?

791
01:12:58,992 --> 01:13:01,911
Or do you think I've lost my shit
and we're gonna fuck each other up?

792
01:13:01,995 --> 01:13:03,329
That's theory two.

793
01:13:09,127 --> 01:13:10,336
Oh, God.

794
01:13:15,133 --> 01:13:16,801
When I look at my hands...

795
01:13:17,802 --> 01:13:19,220
and my fingerprints...

796
01:13:20,930 --> 01:13:22,056
I can see them moving.

797
01:13:25,602 --> 01:13:28,730
I can't.

798
01:13:29,606 --> 01:13:31,107
If I let you go,

799
01:13:31,566 --> 01:13:34,235
and you tie me to a chair
and cut me open...

800
01:13:35,987 --> 01:13:39,449
are my insides gonna move
like my fingerprints?

801
01:13:46,873 --> 01:13:50,710
But... I'm not the one tied to a chair.

802
01:13:54,923 --> 01:13:56,090
-You are.

803
01:14:00,845 --> 01:14:02,805
Help me!

804
01:14:05,642 --> 01:14:06,851
Help me!

805
01:14:07,393 --> 01:14:08,770
Help me!

806
01:14:09,270 --> 01:14:10,813
Oh, Cass?

807
01:14:13,858 --> 01:14:16,277
-You said she was dead.

808
01:14:16,486 --> 01:14:18,947
Cass! Cass, I'm coming!

809
01:14:20,949 --> 01:14:23,242
Cass, is that you

810
01:15:06,369 --> 01:15:11,332
Help me! Help me!

811
01:15:12,166 --> 01:15:14,502
Help!

812
01:15:29,100 --> 01:15:30,143
Don't react.

813
01:15:30,935 --> 01:15:31,936
Mmm.

814
01:15:37,775 --> 01:15:40,820
Me!

815
01:16:07,138 --> 01:16:11,017
Help!

816
01:16:23,529 --> 01:16:25,114
Me!

817
01:16:34,332 --> 01:16:38,169
No! No!

818
01:16:38,252 --> 01:16:39,587
No!

819
01:16:57,688 --> 01:17:00,399
Me!

820
01:17:14,038 --> 01:17:18,042
Help... me...

821
01:17:41,858 --> 01:17:43,317
What are you doing?

822
01:17:43,693 --> 01:17:45,695
-I'm leaving.
 Now?

823
01:17:48,072 --> 01:17:50,700
-It's not even light yet.
-I don't have time to wait.

824
01:17:51,117 --> 01:17:52,743
We are disintegrating.

825
01:17:52,827 --> 01:17:54,912
Our bodies as fast as our minds.
Can't you feel it?

826
01:17:56,622 --> 01:17:58,541
It's like the onset of dementia.

827
01:18:01,586 --> 01:18:03,254
If I don't reach the lighthouse soon...

828
01:18:03,963 --> 01:18:07,383
the person that started this journey
won't be the person that ends it.

829
01:18:07,717 --> 01:18:09,594
I want to be the one that ends it.

830
01:19:11,989 --> 01:19:13,366
We should go, Josie.

831
01:19:21,415 --> 01:19:23,584
How long was your husband in the Shimmer?

832
01:19:25,711 --> 01:19:27,588
It's hard to say exactly.

833
01:19:30,591 --> 01:19:32,635
Theoretically, as long as a year.

834
01:19:35,137 --> 01:19:38,432
That's a long time to be inside
and remain intact.

835
01:19:39,308 --> 01:19:41,143
I'm not so sure he was intact.

836
01:19:45,481 --> 01:19:46,399
I'm right...

837
01:19:47,858 --> 01:19:51,696
-Yeah.

838
01:19:52,321 --> 01:19:54,156
I checked my blood last night.

839
01:19:56,784 --> 01:19:58,953
It's... in me.

840
01:20:02,123 --> 01:20:04,166
It will be in all of us.

841
01:20:10,548 --> 01:20:12,383
It was so strange hearing...

842
01:20:13,259 --> 01:20:16,554
Sheppard's voice in the mouth
of that creature last night.

843
01:20:17,888 --> 01:20:20,975
I think as she was dying,
part of her mind became...

844
01:20:21,892 --> 01:20:24,020
part of the creature that was killing her.

845
01:20:26,230 --> 01:20:28,899
Imagine dying frightened and in pain,

846
01:20:28,983 --> 01:20:32,236
and having that as the only part of you
which survives.

847
01:20:33,696 --> 01:20:35,364
I wouldn't like that at all. Ventress wants to face it.

848
01:20:58,721 --> 01:20:59,972
You want to fight it.

849
01:21:01,766 --> 01:21:04,602
But I don't think I want
either of those things.

850
01:21:12,026 --> 01:21:12,860
Josie. Josie.

851
01:21:26,290 --> 01:21:27,249
Josie!

852
01:21:53,609 --> 01:21:57,571
One by one, all gone, except you.

853
01:21:59,782 --> 01:22:01,075
How do you explain that?

854
01:22:05,204 --> 01:22:07,206
Is it something I need to explain?

855
01:22:08,082 --> 01:22:09,375
Yes, you do.

856
01:22:16,090 --> 01:22:17,216
I had to come back.

857
01:22:19,301 --> 01:22:21,053
I'm not sure any of them did.

881
01:29:08,001 --> 01:29:08,836
No.

882
01:29:11,630 --> 01:29:16,760
<i>Five, four, three, two...</i>

883
01:29:34,528 --> 01:29:37,030
No, no, no.<i> </i>No.

884
01:29:40,075 --> 01:29:43,620
Oh. Oh, God. Oh, my God.

885
01:29:44,204 --> 01:29:45,038
No.

886
01:31:10,415 --> 01:31:12,584
It's the last phase.

887
01:31:14,461 --> 01:31:16,505
Vanished into havoc.

888
01:31:19,967 --> 01:31:23,011
Unfathomable mind...

889
01:31:26,556 --> 01:31:28,684
...and now beacon.

890
01:31:29,476 --> 01:31:31,103
Now sea.

891
01:31:41,822 --> 01:31:42,739
Lena.

892
01:31:50,455 --> 01:31:51,707
We spoke.

893
01:31:53,375 --> 01:31:54,918
What was it we said?

894
01:32:00,632 --> 01:32:05,220
That I needed to know
what was inside the lighthouse.

895
01:32:08,140 --> 01:32:09,433
That moment's passed.

896
01:32:13,395 --> 01:32:15,147
It's inside me now.

897
01:32:16,565 --> 01:32:18,608
What's... inside you?

898
01:32:19,818 --> 01:32:21,194
It's not like us.

899
01:32:22,320 --> 01:32:24,156
It's unlike us.

900
01:32:27,409 --> 01:32:29,036
I don't know what it wants.

901
01:32:29,786 --> 01:32:31,038
Or if it wants.

902
01:32:32,122 --> 01:32:33,457
But it will grow...

903
01:32:33,915 --> 01:32:35,959
until it encompasses everything.

904
01:32:39,129 --> 01:32:40,213
Our bodies and our minds

905
01:32:40,297 --> 01:32:43,508
will be fragmented
into their smallest parts until...

906
01:32:44,342 --> 01:32:46,428
not one part remains.

907
01:32:51,058 --> 01:32:52,517
Annihilation.

908
01:35:47,025 --> 01:35:49,236
No, no, no. No!

909
01:44:11,696 --> 01:44:13,030
So it was alien.

910
01:44:20,163 --> 01:44:21,706
Can you describe its form?

911
01:44:26,586 --> 01:44:27,462
No.

912
01:44:28,463 --> 01:44:30,173
Was it carbon

913
01:44:34,218 --> 01:44:35,052
I don't know.

914
01:44:37,972 --> 01:44:39,223
What did it want?

915
01:44:40,892 --> 01:44:42,894
I don't think it wanted anything.

916
01:44:43,352 --> 01:44:45,897
But it... it attacked you.

917
01:44:46,814 --> 01:44:48,191
It mirrored me.

918
01:44:49,192 --> 01:44:50,276
I attacked it.

919
01:44:51,903 --> 01:44:53,946
I'm not sure it even knew I was there.

920
01:44:54,030 --> 01:44:55,656
It came here for a reason.

921
01:44:57,033 --> 01:45:00,703
It was mutating our environment,
it was destroying everything.

922
01:45:01,996 --> 01:45:03,998
It wasn't destroying. It was changing everything.

923
01:45:08,377 --> 01:45:10,379
It was making something new.

924
01:45:13,508 --> 01:45:14,467
Making what?

925
01:45:22,767 --> 01:45:23,684
I don't know.

926
01:45:28,231 --> 01:45:30,942
A team reached the lighthouse
a few hours ago.

927
01:45:32,151 --> 01:45:33,736
Everything is ash.

928
01:45:34,445 --> 01:45:37,615
If what you encountered was once alive...

929
01:45:38,449 --> 01:45:39,826
it seems it's now dead.

930
01:46:01,764 --> 01:46:04,308
Now will you tell me what happened
to my husband?

931
01:46:06,060 --> 01:46:07,728
<i>When the Shimmer disappeared,</i>

932
01:46:07,812 --> 01:46:11,858
<i>his blood pressure stabilized</i>
<i>and his pulse rate started to rise.</i>

933
01:46:13,359 --> 01:46:15,486
<i>A few hours later, he was not only awake,</i>

934
01:46:15,570 --> 01:46:16,654
<i>he was lucid.</i>

935
01:46:18,322 --> 01:46:20,408
<i>He's still in isolation, obviously.</i>

936
01:46:21,868 --> 01:46:22,869
<i>So am I.</i>

937
01:47:07,038 --> 01:47:08,164
You aren't Kane...

938
01:47:09,999 --> 01:47:10,917
are you?

939
01:47:17,548 --> 01:47:18,674
I don't think so.

940
01:47:27,099 --> 01:47:28,184
Are you Lena?
