1
00:01:05,273 --> 00:01:06,441
What did you eat?

2
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:10,236
You had rations for two weeks.

3
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,280
You were inside for nearly four months.

4
00:01:13,281 --> 00:01:14,741
I don't remember eating.

5
00:01:17,952 --> 00:01:19,913
How long did you think you were inside?

6
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:23,249
Days.

7
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:25,794
Maybe weeks.

8
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:31,466
What happened to Josie Radek?

9
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:42,268
-I don't know.

10
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:44,270
Thorensen? Dead.

11
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:50,693
Ventress?

12
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:56,950
I don't know.

13
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,161
Then what do you know?

14
00:02:57,552 --> 00:02:59,554
This is a cell.

15
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:04,475
Like all cells,
it is born from an existing cell.

16
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,394
And by extension,

17
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:09,856
all cells were ultimately born
from one cell.

18
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:14,319
A single organism alone on planet Earth,

19
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:16,070
perhaps alone in the universe.

20
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:18,531
About four billion years ago...

21
00:03:19,824 --> 00:03:21,951
one became two, two became four.

22
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:25,914
Then eight, 16, 32.

23
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:28,917
The rhythm of the dividing pair...

24
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:34,464
which becomes the structure
of every microbe,

25
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:37,300
blade of grass, sea creature,
land creature...

26
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:38,885
and human.

27
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:42,013
The structure of everything that lives...

28
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:45,308
and everything that dies.

29
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:49,437
As students of medicine,
as the doctors of tomorrow,

30
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:50,939
this is where you come in.

31
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:55,735
The cell we're looking at is from a tumor.

32
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:59,405
Female patient, early 30s,
taken from the cervix.

33
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:01,199
Over the course of the next term,

34
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:04,118
we will be closely examining cancer cells
in vitro

35
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:06,162
and discussing autophagic activity.

36
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:09,207
Hey, Katie.

37
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,417
I read the John Sulston paper
last night.

38
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:13,294
I still feel like
I'm not working hard enough.

39
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:14,921
I'm behind the other students.

40
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:17,674
-They find everything easier.
 You aren't, and they don't.

41
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:18,800
-Lena!

42
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:21,970
Dan.

43
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:25,682
I've been looking for you at lunch,
but you never seem to be around.

44
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:28,017
I've been catching up on some writing.

45
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:31,312
All work and no play, it sounds...
not healthy.

46
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,857
I wanted to ask,

47
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:37,318
Sarah and I have a few people over.

48
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:41,906
A garden party while the weather holds.

49
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:45,201
Actually, I do have plans.

50
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:46,828
I think it'll be fun.

51
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:50,373
Thanks, Dan, I really appreciate it,
but I'm going to paint our bedr--

52
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:51,624
The bedroom.

53
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:55,920
It's been a year, Lena.

54
00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:02,343
You're allowed to come to a barbecue.
It is not a betrayal

55
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:04,595
or an insult to his memory.

56
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:09,142
I'm gonna paint the bedroom.

57
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:15,690

No one knew anything about your unit.

92
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,138
I contacted everyone.

93
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,764
Everyone I could.

94
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:56,642
The other partners knew
just as little as me.

95
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:03,357
Was it covert?

96
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:07,445
Mm... Maybe.

97
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:10,198
What does that mean, "maybe"?

98
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:15,286
Okay, yeah, it was covert.
Yeah, I think so.

99
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:16,913
Pakistan again?

100
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:23,085
I-- I don't know where it was, or...

101
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:26,589
what it was.

102
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:30,134
How is that possible?
 Was it warm?

103
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:31,969
Was there snow?

104
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:37,016
Did the people there speak Portuguese,
or Swahili, or Pashto?

105
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:43,272
How long have you been back?

106
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:45,233
I don't know.

107
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:47,693
How'd you get back?
What base did you fly into?

108
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:52,740
-I don't know.

109
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:57,828
You must be able to tell me something.

110
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:01,541
You vanished off the face of the earth
for 12 months.

111
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,252
I deserve a better explanation
than no explanation.

112
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:05,419
Does it matter?

113
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:29,527
Kane...

114
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,488
how did you get home?

115
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:34,782
Hmm?

116
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:37,535
I was outside.

117
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:40,413
Outside the house?

118
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:42,707
No.

119
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:45,167
No, I was outside the room.

120
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:49,297
The room with the bed.

121
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:52,758
The door was open, and...

122
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:55,845
I saw you.

123
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:01,517
I recognized you.

124
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:06,731
Your face.

125
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:22,955
I don't feel very well.

126
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:33,007
Stay with me, baby.

127
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:35,343
-I'm right here with you.

128
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:37,845
Male, 31, hemorrhage, in seizure.

129
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:40,348
Stay with me, baby. I love you.

130
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:42,850
Baby, look at me. Can you do something?!

131
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,230
You call for a police escort?

132
00:10:58,199 --> 00:10:59,617
Hey, easy, easy!

133
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,631
Out of the truck, now!

134
00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:15,633
What are you doing?

135
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:17,343
Out!
 Don't shoot!

136
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:18,844
Out! Move!

137
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:20,179
Out, out, out!

138
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:21,430
What's going on?

139
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:24,308
What are you doing?
You can't move him!

140
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:27,019
Let him go! Let him go!

141
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:31,023
Let him go!

142
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:32,668
You must be feeling dreadful.

143
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:36,338
It's a hangover
from the sedative you were given.

144
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:38,215
Come on, sit down.

145
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:43,763
Who are you?

146
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:55,816
My name is Dr. Ventress.

147
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:58,194
I'm a psychologist.

148
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:01,030
Why am I talking to a psychologist?

149
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,075
Am I in a psychiatric hospital?

150
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:07,203
-No.
 Then what?

151
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:08,871
Where am I?

152
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:11,540
Where's my husband?

153
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,502
You served in the military
for seven years.

154
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:18,839
I'm a professor from Johns Hopkins.

155
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:21,425
I want to know what the fuck
I'm doing here.

156
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:26,055
Your research area is the genetically
programmed life cycle of a cell.

157
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:27,556
Where is my husband?

158
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,601
Yeah,
I'd like to talk about Sergeant Kane.

159
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:33,979
When did he arrive back home?

160
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:39,527
-I want to see a lawyer.
-You're not gonna be able to.

161
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:46,534
Did he explain how he got back?

162
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:51,121
-No.
-Did he contact you at any point

163
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:52,289
while he was away?

164
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:53,833
No.

165
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:58,003
What did he tell you
about his mission when he returned?

166
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:00,923
-Nothing.

167
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:03,884
Did he ever mention where he was going,
what he was doing?

168
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,761
He never said, I never asked.

169
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:10,558
But you made regular requests
for information from his unit CO.

170
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:13,894
Until six months ago,
and then you stopped.

171
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:19,275
Why was that

172
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:20,818
Time to move on?

173
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:24,488
It's not easy to move on.

174
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:27,408
I didn't.

175
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:37,835
I'm done answering questions.
It's your turn.

176
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:40,921
Your husband's here.

177
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:44,258
He's extremely ill.

178
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:47,177
Multiple organ failure.

179
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:50,431
Massive internal bleeding.

180
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:55,102
He must have been exposed
to some sort of radiation,

181
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:57,354
some kind of virus.

182
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,399
You have to tell me where he was,
what he was doing.

183
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:05,362
I could actually help him.

184
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:51,492
<i>A religious event.</i>

185
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:54,578
<i>An extraterrestrial event.</i>

186
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:57,164
<i>A higher dimension.</i>

187
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,667
We have many theories,

188
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:01,251
few facts.

189
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:04,463
It started around three years ago.

190
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:08,550
Blackwater National Park reported
that a lighthouse was surrounded

191
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:11,303
by something they termed "a shimmer."

192
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:15,516
One of the wardens went in to investigate.

193
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:17,601
Never returned.

194
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:20,396
The event was classified.

195
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:23,440
Since then, we've approached by land,
by sea,

196
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:26,902
sent in drones, animals,
and teams of people.

197
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,446
But nothing comes back.

198
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:32,950
And the boundary's getting bigger.
It's expanding.

199
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:35,744
So far, it's eating
into barely populated swampland,

200
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:40,290
which, you know, we evacuated
under the pretext of a chemical spill,

201
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:43,043
but... that won't last much longer.

202
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:48,841
In a few months, the area will have grown
to where we are right now.

203
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:54,138
And then we're talking cities...

204
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:56,181
states... and so on.

205
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:03,188
You said nothing comes back.

206
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:05,858
But something has.

207
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:08,777
Yes.

208
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:18,579
He's dying.

209
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:21,457
Yes.

210
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:28,088
We need to come to an agreement
about what to do with you.

211
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:30,215
You're not going to let me go home?

212
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:36,555
Is that what you want

213
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:41,643
No.

214
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:44,313
I want to be with him.

215
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:04,833
You're not talking to me.

216
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:07,836
Sorry.

217
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:10,506
Zoned out.

218
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:13,884
Thinking about the next mission?

219
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:17,471
No.

220
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,265
I was just looking at the moon.

221
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:25,771
It's always so weird seeing it like that
in the daylight.

222
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:27,815
Like God made a mistake.

223
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:29,775
-Left the hall lights on.

224
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:31,860
God doesn't make mistakes. That's...

225
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:34,863
somewhat key
to the whole "being a god" thing.

226
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:38,200
Pretty sure he does.

227
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:41,745
You know he's listening right now,
don't you?

228
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:44,665
You take a cell,

229
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:47,417
circumvent the Hayflick limit,
you can prevent senescence.

230
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:51,171
I was about to make the exact same point.

231
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:54,299
It means the cell doesn't grow old,
it becomes immortal.

232
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:55,592
Keeps dividing, doesn't die.

233
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,933
They say aging is a natural process,
but it's actually a fault in our genes.

234
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:07,646
I get really turned on
when you patronize me. It's really hot.

235
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:10,649
Without it,
I could keep looking like this forever.

236
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:11,859
Oh, okay.

237
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:14,236
-Well, that could constitute a mistake.

238
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:22,494
You didn't tell me
where you're heading this time.

239
00:19:24,454 --> 00:19:27,583
I know there's something strange
about this mission.

240
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:32,171
Why?

241
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:36,842
The silence around it
is louder than usual.

242
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:41,930
Kind of angling for a clue here.

243
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:47,269
So...?

244
00:19:51,815 --> 00:19:53,358
We'll be under the same hemisphere.

245
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:56,778
What does that tell me?

246
00:19:58,822 --> 00:20:01,658
It tells you that if you step outside
and you look up...

247
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:04,995
we'll be looking at the same stars.

248
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:07,497
-Holy fucking shit.

249
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,293
You think that's what I do
while you're away?

250
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:15,047
-You think I'm out in the garden,

251
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:16,840
pining, looking up at the sky?

252
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:21,803
Shut up. All right.
-Oh, to think my beloved Kane...

253
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:25,390
-Okay. Uh-huh.
-...is looking at the selfsame moon.

254
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:26,975
Stop it.

255
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:30,562
Oh,
my distant celestial friend...

256
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:32,773
No. No.

257
00:20:33,106 --> 00:20:35,400
...please care for my brave soldier.

258
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:37,402
Jesus. You know what?
You are disrespectful,

259
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:40,197
seriously, not only to your former
comrades in the armed forces,

260
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,407
-but also to the president.
-You forgot the flag.

261
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:45,285
Oh, I'm getting--
I'm getting to the motherfucking flag.

262
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:46,411
Oh, my hero.

263
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:48,205
-Screw you.
-Okay.

264
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:01,802
She's all by herself.
Don't you think we should make friends?

265
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:04,721
Well, obviously <i>you </i>should.
 Yep, I'll do it.

266
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:09,476
Hey. Hey.

267
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,647
-No, not at all.

268
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:16,733
Cool. Phew.

269
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:19,236
You know, I always see you here alone.
It's...

270
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:24,574
I'm guessing you probably feel weird
or awkward.

271
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:27,661
Somewhat, I guess.

272
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:31,498
Don't. Seriously, don't.

273
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:35,085
The people here put themselves to sleep
in the fetal position

274
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:36,461
making cooing noises.

275
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:39,172
It's freaky, you know.

276
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:42,676
-I'm Anya.
-Lena.

277
00:21:43,176 --> 00:21:44,970
-Nice to meet you.
-You, too.

278
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:48,181
Um, why don't you come and meet my crew?

279
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:50,058
Come make friends. Come on.

280
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:54,187
Ladies, meet Lena.

281
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:56,273
Hi nice to meet you.

282
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:59,192
Yeah, that's Cassie Sheppard,
and Josie Radek.

283
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:00,986
Hi. Nice to meet you.
-Hi.

284
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:03,780
Do you want to have a seat?
-Thank you.

285
00:22:03,905 --> 00:22:07,159
-So, first day at the Southern Reach.
-Yes.

286
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:08,744
-Ah!

287
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:10,287
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

288
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,539
You all been here long?

289
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:15,542
Um, yeah, right from the start.

290
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:17,085
I'm a geomorphologist.

291
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:20,255
I've been testing the magnetic fields
around the boundary,

292
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:23,633
which is like using confetti
to test a hurricane.

293
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:27,888
Uh, and I've been here... ten months.

294
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:29,598
Wow, ten months.

295
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:31,141
Paramedic from Chicago.

296
00:22:31,224 --> 00:22:33,310
Tried to join an NGO,
but my application<i> </i>got flagged,

297
00:22:33,393 --> 00:22:34,644
so Southern Reach got me.

298
00:22:34,978 --> 00:22:37,189
Only two months. I'm a physicist.

299
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:39,733
I came straight from my Cambridge postdoc.

300
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,818
She's very smart.

301
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:44,196
What's your story, Lena?

302
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:46,740
Uh, I'm from Johns Hopkins, biologist.

303
00:22:46,823 --> 00:22:48,492
-Oh, there you go.

304
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:50,118
-Told you she was smart.
 What?

305
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:53,455
We had a bet on your profession,
and Josie had biologist, of course.

306
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:58,502
-I had law enforcement.
-I had you as single.

307
00:22:58,585 --> 00:23:01,254
Jesus. Do you have to hit
on everyone, like all the time?

308
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:02,923
Fuck that. Under the circumstances,

309
00:23:03,006 --> 00:23:05,926
I think I'm allowed to roll the dice
a few more times.

310
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:07,969
Under what circumstances?

311
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:13,892
Well, yeah, um, crazy as it seems...

312
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:16,061
Crazy as it <i>is.</i>

313
00:23:18,772 --> 00:23:20,482
...we are headed that way.

314
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:28,365
-Six days and counting.

315
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:32,077
-Four.

316
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:33,662
Ventress.

317
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:38,083
Mmm. Team leader.

318
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:41,336
-All women.
-Scientists.

319
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:44,965
The previous teams
have been largely military, so, yeah.

320
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:47,759
What do you think happened to them?

321
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:51,555
Well, there are two theories
of what went wrong in the Shimmer.

322
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:54,182
One, something kills them.

323
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:56,852
Two, they go crazy and kill each other.

324
00:23:58,603 --> 00:24:00,856
There was one military guy
who made it out.

325
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:01,773
Yeah. A sergeant.

326
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:05,485
Yeah, but you heard
about the state that he was in.

327
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:54,701
Kane...

328
00:24:57,662 --> 00:24:59,539
I know why you went in.

329
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:10,091
I am so sorry.

330
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:14,846
And I know what I have to do.

331
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:22,020
<i>So you didn't tell them</i>
<i>about your connection to Sergeant Kane?</i>

332
00:25:22,437 --> 00:25:25,106
I thought it would complicate things.

333
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:27,025
What?

334
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:29,444
What would it complicate?

335
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:38,495
Why are you going into the Shimmer?

336
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:45,126
The mission statement is to reach
the supposed source of the Shimmer,

337
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:49,881
the lighthouse,
enter and acquire data, and return.

338
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:54,886
But I don't think that
that's your mission statement.

339
00:26:00,183 --> 00:26:01,017
No.

340
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:12,654
I've been watching the phenomenon
for a while now.

341
00:26:13,613 --> 00:26:16,241
I profile the volunteers.

342
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,452
I pick the teams.

343
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:24,499
They enter, I watch.

344
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,004
I watch it grow closer.

345
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:34,217
There's only so long one can do that.

346
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:38,138
But you need to know what's inside?

347
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:42,058
Yes, I do.

348
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:46,104
So do I.

349
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:49,107
So that's the complication.

350
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:52,110
You want to come with us.

351
00:26:53,486 --> 00:26:55,572
I can't do anything for him here.

352
00:26:57,324 --> 00:26:58,992
Soldier-scientist.

353
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,703
You can fight.

354
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:03,955
You can learn.

355
00:27:06,499 --> 00:27:07,792
You can save him.

356
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:16,259
You requested to join the mission.

357
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:18,887
You knew all other missions had failed

358
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:21,473
and the only survivor
was barely surviving.

359
00:27:22,682 --> 00:27:23,892
That was a brave choice.

360
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:25,935
I owed him.

361
00:27:28,521 --> 00:27:30,899
I'm only trying to understand
what drove you.

362
00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:35,362
I owed him...

363
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:39,115
so I went in.

364
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:25,907
And then we get some real meals.

365
00:30:26,699 --> 00:30:29,786
Spaghetti.
Here's Radek's vegetable crackers.

366
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:34,249
Wow, cornbread. That's not so bad.

367
00:30:34,749 --> 00:30:36,042
Oh, you're finally awake.

368
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:39,838
You gotta give me a second.
I'm a little disoriented.

369
00:30:40,296 --> 00:30:41,589
Join the club.

370
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:44,217
You don't remember
setting up camp, do you?

371
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:50,139
I don't remember anything...
after we reached the tree line.

372
00:30:51,474 --> 00:30:52,308
None of us do.

373
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:54,936
And we did a food inventory.

374
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:59,941
From the depletion, we've been out here
for at least three or four days.

375
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:02,485
That's not possible.

376
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:04,445
That's what I said.

377
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:11,202
Guys, I've been checking
my comms and nav equipment.

378
00:31:11,494 --> 00:31:13,621
They boot up fine,
no problem with the electronics,

379
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:15,123
and the camera is working,

380
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:19,085
but anything that sends a signal
out of the Shimmer... is down.

381
00:31:19,794 --> 00:31:22,672
Even though we've probably got
about 20 satellites above us right now,

382
00:31:22,755 --> 00:31:24,966
and... check this out.

383
00:31:28,094 --> 00:31:32,473
So we've got no compass,
no comms, no coordinates...

384
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:34,475
and no landmarks.

385
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,436
Well, we know we're in the state park.

386
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:37,896
We head south, we hit the ocean,

387
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:41,858
then we can just follow the shoreline
until we hit the perimeter wall. Right?

388
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:46,029
-Come on, Josie, you know this.

389
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:47,739
Hour hand at the sun.

390
00:31:49,115 --> 00:31:51,701
Split the difference
between the hour hand and 12, south.

391
00:31:52,827 --> 00:31:53,786
Good.

392
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:55,163
We're oriented.

393
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:59,167
We weren't really expecting
the comms equipment to work, were we?

394
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:03,129
There's been three years of expeditions
and three years of radio silence.

395
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:06,215
Let's pack up and get moving.

396
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:08,593
We've already lost a lot of the day.

397
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:12,323
Oh, I'm gonna check this out.
Get us out of this damn swamp.

398
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:15,493
All right.
Let's check out the hut.

399
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:36,431
Looks like someone's
about to have a wedding. These are very strange.

400
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,104
Why?

401
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:46,858
Well, they're all so different.

402
00:33:47,316 --> 00:33:50,778
To look at them, you wouldn't say
that they're the same species.

403
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:54,198
But they're growing
from the same branch structure...

404
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:57,493
so it has to be the same species.

405
00:33:58,161 --> 00:33:59,620
It's the same plant.

406
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:03,332
It's like they're stuck
in a continuous mutation.

407
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:04,667
A pathology?

408
00:34:05,918 --> 00:34:06,878
Yeah, well...

409
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:12,091
you'd sure as hell call it a pathology
if you saw this in a human.

410
00:34:22,935 --> 00:34:24,854
Jackpot.

411
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:27,732
Sheppard! Mode of transportation.

412
00:34:32,945 --> 00:34:34,363
Anything interesting in there?

413
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:37,492
No. It's been long abandoned,
maybe even before--

414
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,036
Radek?

415
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:42,497
Radek!

416
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:44,415
-Radek!

417
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:45,708
It's got my bag!

418
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:47,043
Radek!

419
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:52,256
Something's got my bag!

420
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:53,966
Oh, no!

421
00:34:54,675 --> 00:34:55,676
It's got my bag!

422
00:35:00,556 --> 00:35:02,809
Help me with her!
 What's going on?

423
00:35:04,393 --> 00:35:05,853
Hey, grab my shoulder!

424
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:10,483
Get her. Come on.

425
00:35:11,984 --> 00:35:13,069
I got her.

426
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:14,821
Okay

427
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:16,280
I got her. Okay.

428
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:17,406
You're good, you're good.

429
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:19,367
It's okay.

430
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:28,668
Let's sit you down.
Help me with her bag.

431
00:35:28,751 --> 00:35:31,129
Okay, just breathe.
It's okay. You're just fine.

432
00:35:31,212 --> 00:35:33,464
-Something in the water.

433
00:35:44,934 --> 00:35:46,769
-Get up, get up. Go.

434
00:35:56,612 --> 00:35:58,322
Oh, shit! Get back.

435
00:36:03,035 --> 00:36:05,830
Sheppard! Sheppard, watch out!

436
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:11,043
-Holy fuck!

437
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:53,461
Whoa.

438
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:57,673
It's exactly the same as the flowers.

439
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:00,134
Look at the teeth.

440
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:03,179
Concentric rows.

441
00:37:04,013 --> 00:37:06,933
Something here is making giant waves
in the gene pool.

442
00:37:07,516 --> 00:37:09,060
Sharks have teeth like that, don't they?

443
00:37:09,143 --> 00:37:11,145
Do you think it's a crossbreed?

444
00:37:12,521 --> 00:37:15,608
You can't crossbreed
between different species.

445
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:20,905
Lena, this is getting heavy.

446
00:37:30,456 --> 00:37:33,000
The mutations were subtle at first.

447
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:37,505
More extreme as we grew closer
to the lighthouse.

448
00:37:39,048 --> 00:37:41,050
Corruptions of form.

449
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:44,178
Duplicates of form.

450
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:45,263
Duplicates?

451
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:49,767
Echoes.

452
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:56,607
Is it possible these were hallucinations?

453
00:37:59,068 --> 00:38:01,070
I wondered that myself.

454
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:04,615
But they were shared among all of us.

455
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:08,661
It was dreamlike.

456
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:11,163
Nightmarish.

457
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:13,165
Not always.

458
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:17,628
Sometimes it was beautiful.

459
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:43,946
Ow.

460
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:46,991
You hurt?

461
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:49,201
It's just a bruise.

462
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:52,788
Must have gotten that from the gator.

463
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:54,123
Yeah.

464
00:38:59,128 --> 00:39:01,172
So, where'd you learn to shoot?

465
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:05,843
I was in the military
before I was an academic.

466
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:07,845
Marines?

467
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:09,930
Army. Seven years.

468
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:12,683
Feels like a lifetime ago now.

469
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:13,768
Yeah.

470
00:39:15,394 --> 00:39:17,813
All other lives feel like a lifetime ago.

471
00:39:18,397 --> 00:39:20,441
We were kids, I was married.

472
00:39:21,817 --> 00:39:25,237
Which do you carry around your neck?
A husband or a child?

473
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:26,655
Husband.

474
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:30,201
He was in the army, too. That's...

475
00:39:30,951 --> 00:39:32,036
That's how we met.

476
00:39:33,287 --> 00:39:34,580
"Was" in the army

477
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:37,291
KIA.

478
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:40,628
I'm sorry to hear that.

479
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,006
Guess there had to be something.

480
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:45,508
What do you mean?

481
00:39:48,135 --> 00:39:50,638
Volunteering for... this.

482
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:54,392
It's not exactly something you do
if your life is in... perfect harmony.

483
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:58,979
We're all damaged goods here.

484
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:01,065
Anya is sober...

485
00:40:01,857 --> 00:40:03,067
therefore an addict.

486
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:05,528
Josie wears long sleeves

487
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:08,322
'cause she doesn't want you
to see the scars on her forearms.

488
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:10,074
She's tried to kill herself?

489
00:40:10,699 --> 00:40:13,494
No, I think the opposite,
trying to feel alive.

490
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:17,498
Ventress?

491
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:21,252
Yeah. As far as anyone knows...

492
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:26,090
no friends, no family,
no partner, no children.

493
00:40:27,216 --> 00:40:29,009
No concession in her at all.

494
00:40:32,179 --> 00:40:35,099
-I also lost someone.

495
00:40:37,935 --> 00:40:39,520
Not a husband, though, um...

496
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:42,189
A daughter. Leukemia.

497
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:44,567
God, I'm sorry.

498
00:40:45,317 --> 00:40:46,986
In a way, it's two bereavements.

499
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:51,657
My... beautiful girl...

500
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:55,202
and the person I once was.

501
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:56,537
Hey, hey!

502
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:58,831
We got something here.

503
00:41:30,362 --> 00:41:33,115
This used to be the headquarters
of the Southern Reach.

504
00:41:34,408 --> 00:41:35,951
Before the Shimmer swallowed it.

505
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:40,873
More mutations.

506
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:43,125
They're everywhere.

507
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:45,211
Malignant.

508
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:47,463
Like tumors.

509
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,883
Is that the old mess hall?

510
00:41:51,091 --> 00:41:51,926
Yeah.

511
00:41:52,134 --> 00:41:54,470
Let's billet there. Come on.

512
00:42:30,005 --> 00:42:32,883
There's beds and bags.
You think people are here?

513
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:35,052
Were here.

514
00:42:36,178 --> 00:42:38,138
Yeah, I'm gonna go with the past tense.

515
00:42:58,909 --> 00:42:59,743
Damn.

516
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:04,498
Oh.

517
00:43:06,166 --> 00:43:07,459
Oh, shit.

518
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:19,471
This shit is heavy. Can't carry this.

519
00:43:36,488 --> 00:43:37,656
Lena, what you got going on?

520
00:43:39,825 --> 00:43:41,076
Guys, check this out.

521
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:45,497
"Peyton, Mayer...

522
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:49,793
Kane, Shelley."

523
00:43:50,377 --> 00:43:52,546
Those were the soldiers
on the last expedition.

524
00:43:52,921 --> 00:43:55,758
Looks like they were using this room
as their base of operations.

525
00:43:55,841 --> 00:43:57,635
Why are some of the names crossed out?

526
00:43:57,718 --> 00:43:59,345
Let's not jump to conclusions.

527
00:43:59,428 --> 00:44:01,680
-I don't know, maybe we should.
-Yeah.

528
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:05,684
Yep. This is the mess hall.

529
00:44:05,768 --> 00:44:07,102
Yep.

530
00:44:07,186 --> 00:44:10,230
I think that the times by the names
are a guard rota, so...

531
00:44:10,939 --> 00:44:12,691
if they were guarding the perimeter,
we should.

532
00:44:12,775 --> 00:44:14,443
Copy that.
 Yep.

533
00:44:27,539 --> 00:44:29,875
This might be able to tell us something.

534
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:35,422
"For those that follow."

535
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:39,301
I believe that means us.

536
00:44:48,268 --> 00:44:49,311
Memory card.

537
00:44:52,064 --> 00:44:53,857
I should be able to play this.

538
00:45:01,448 --> 00:45:02,658
It's working.

539
00:45:07,496 --> 00:45:08,622
<i>All right?</i>

540
00:45:13,669 --> 00:45:15,421
<i></i>
<i>-Okay.</i>

541
00:45:15,879 --> 00:45:16,714
<i>Okay.</i>

542
00:45:26,932 --> 00:45:28,976
<i>Okay. Okay. Okay.</i> <i>Okay.</i>

543
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:30,811
<i>Okay. Okay.</i>
 <i>Yeah?</i>

544
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:32,312
<i>Okay.</i>

545
00:45:45,868 --> 00:45:46,869
Shit.

546
00:45:47,911 --> 00:45:49,079
What is he doing?

547
00:45:57,254 --> 00:45:59,798
<i>Stop. Stop. Stop, stop, stop.</i>

548
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:02,968
<i>Hold him. Hold him down.</i>

549
00:46:05,053 --> 00:46:06,847
<i>Oh, yeah. Yeah.</i>

550
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:08,265
<i>There. There.</i>

551
00:46:24,990 --> 00:46:28,202
Okay, so we know what happened
to the last group. They went insane.

552
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:31,163
-Was something alive inside that man.
-No.

553
00:46:31,246 --> 00:46:33,332
-That was a trick of the light.
 What?

554
00:46:33,415 --> 00:46:36,376
I've been a paramedic for 10 years.
I've scraped people off the road.

555
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:39,338
You see some weird shit.
That was a trick of the light.

556
00:46:39,421 --> 00:46:41,965
His insides were moving.
 No, it was shock.

557
00:46:42,049 --> 00:46:44,176
-That was a shock response.
 Watch it again.

558
00:46:44,259 --> 00:46:46,011
No, I'm not gonna watch it again!

559
00:46:46,094 --> 00:46:48,055
That was not intestines.
It was a worm--

560
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:50,224
Okay, then you watch it, Sheppard!

561
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:55,646
Where are you going?

562
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:11,620
-Just ahead.

563
00:48:08,594 --> 00:48:09,428
What is it?

564
00:48:10,762 --> 00:48:11,889
I don't know.

565
00:48:29,823 --> 00:48:32,409
-I don't want to stay here tonight.
-We don't have a choice.

566
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:36,246
Please.
-Come on.

567
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:39,207
It's too late in the day
for us to move on.

568
00:48:39,541 --> 00:48:41,043
Come on, let's go outside.

569
00:49:22,751 --> 00:49:24,878
Oh, that's nice of you.

570
00:49:27,547 --> 00:49:29,341
Why aren't you here?

571
00:49:31,593 --> 00:49:33,136
I gotta leave a day early.

572
00:49:33,887 --> 00:49:34,763
What?

573
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:37,391
Wait, today?

574
00:49:39,017 --> 00:49:41,228
-Right now.
-Oh, shit.

575
00:49:41,603 --> 00:49:43,146
But we had a whole day planned.

576
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:45,273
-We were gonna drive to the country--
-No, we can't.

577
00:49:46,191 --> 00:49:48,193
-We can't.

578
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:55,117
Now means right now.

579
00:49:58,954 --> 00:49:59,788
Yeah.

580
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:04,251
What is it?

581
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:12,592
I do...

582
00:50:16,638 --> 00:50:17,514
love you...

583
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:19,599
Lena.

584
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:23,020
I love you, too.

585
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:21,495
Hey.

586
00:51:23,538 --> 00:51:24,706
The mystery unraveling?

587
00:51:26,792 --> 00:51:28,460
Something's unraveling.

588
00:51:29,628 --> 00:51:31,129
I think you're doing okay.

589
00:51:33,548 --> 00:51:35,050
It's good Josie's getting some rest.

590
00:51:35,133 --> 00:51:35,967
Yeah.

591
00:51:36,343 --> 00:51:38,220
With the help of a little sedative.

592
00:51:38,303 --> 00:51:40,722
How about you

593
00:51:41,598 --> 00:51:42,432
Some.

594
00:51:43,558 --> 00:51:45,644
I'm at least as freaked as Josie.

595
00:51:47,354 --> 00:51:48,980
I'm just hiding it better.

596
00:51:52,901 --> 00:51:54,111
I should check on Ventress.

597
00:51:55,987 --> 00:51:56,822
Yep.

598
00:52:28,812 --> 00:52:31,231
What're you doing up?
Not supposed to relieve me until 3:00.

599
00:52:31,314 --> 00:52:33,233
I'm done sleeping for the night.

600
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:34,734
Okay.

601
00:52:36,653 --> 00:52:37,737
Come look at this.

602
00:52:41,283 --> 00:52:42,617
Okay, this is where we are...

603
00:52:44,327 --> 00:52:45,745
and that's the lighthouse.

604
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:48,165
Southwest is Ville Perdu.

605
00:52:48,248 --> 00:52:50,959
It's a small community we evacuated
two years ago.

606
00:52:51,585 --> 00:52:54,254
I think we should head there tomorrow,

607
00:52:54,921 --> 00:52:57,674
and then head out for the coast
the following morning.

608
00:53:01,136 --> 00:53:01,970
Good.

609
00:53:07,434 --> 00:53:08,435
You okay?

610
00:53:14,649 --> 00:53:16,151
I was gonna say, when...

611
00:53:16,943 --> 00:53:19,321
you didn't tell the team
about your connection to Kane,

612
00:53:19,404 --> 00:53:21,364
I wasn't sure if that was a good idea.

613
00:53:23,909 --> 00:53:25,952
But after seeing that footage...

614
00:53:29,206 --> 00:53:30,040
yeah.

615
00:53:30,957 --> 00:53:33,376
I'm not sure how they would have reacted
to you.

616
00:53:36,254 --> 00:53:38,423
Why did my husband volunteer
for a suicide mission?

617
00:53:39,132 --> 00:53:40,800
Is that what you think we're doing?

618
00:53:41,635 --> 00:53:43,803
-You must have profiled him,

619
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:45,263
you must have assessed him.

620
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:48,183
He must have said something.

621
00:53:49,684 --> 00:53:51,895
So you're asking me as a psychologist.

622
00:53:53,688 --> 00:53:54,522
Yeah.

623
00:53:55,941 --> 00:53:57,692
Then, as a psychologist...

624
00:53:58,693 --> 00:54:02,280
I'd say you're confusing suicide
with self-destruction.

625
00:54:04,783 --> 00:54:07,035
Almost none of us commit suicide...

626
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:10,080
and almost all of us self-destruct.

627
00:54:10,288 --> 00:54:12,958
In some way, in some part of our lives.

628
00:54:14,292 --> 00:54:16,920
We drink, or we smoke.

629
00:54:17,379 --> 00:54:19,506
We destabilize the good job.

630
00:54:21,883 --> 00:54:23,176
Or the happy marriage.

631
00:54:28,473 --> 00:54:30,475
These aren't decisions, they're...

632
00:54:31,393 --> 00:54:32,560
They're impulses.

633
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:37,941
In fact, you're probably better equipped
to explain this than I am.

634
00:54:39,985 --> 00:54:41,236
You're a biologist.

635
00:54:42,612 --> 00:54:45,031
Isn't self

636
00:54:45,448 --> 00:54:46,908
Programmed into each cell?

637
00:54:49,869 --> 00:54:50,870
What was that?

638
00:54:50,954 --> 00:54:52,455
-Don't know.

639
00:55:04,384 --> 00:55:05,302
Josie, wake up.

640
00:55:05,552 --> 00:55:07,762
Wake up, Josie, come on.
Wake up. Something's happening.

641
00:55:08,221 --> 00:55:10,015
-No.

642
00:55:10,515 --> 00:55:12,100
What happened? I heard a noise.

643
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:14,811
Oh.
 What?

644
00:55:17,647 --> 00:55:19,024
Something's come through the fence.

645
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:22,777
-It's ripped open like a fucking zipper.

646
00:55:28,366 --> 00:55:29,200
Can't see.

647
00:55:29,284 --> 00:55:30,785
-Yeah, neither can I.

648
00:55:33,079 --> 00:55:34,122
Sheppard!

649
00:55:34,205 --> 00:55:35,832
Sheppard!

650
00:55:35,915 --> 00:55:37,876
-Fuck!

651
00:55:37,959 --> 00:55:39,836
Sheppard was next to me.
Something took her.

652
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:43,923
-Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck! Sheppard!

653
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:44,841
Oh, shit!

654
00:55:44,924 --> 00:55:48,553
Help! Help me!

655
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:53,224
Shepp... Sheppard!

656
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:03,485
Sheppard!

657
00:56:33,181 --> 00:56:34,224
We have to go back.

658
00:56:34,808 --> 00:56:37,060
-We have to go back now.
 She's right.

659
00:56:37,310 --> 00:56:39,062
Right

660
00:56:39,145 --> 00:56:40,605
We've been attacked twice.

661
00:56:40,855 --> 00:56:42,732
We lost one of our own.

662
00:56:42,816 --> 00:56:45,944
We have evidence the previous team
went nuts and chopped each other up.

663
00:56:46,027 --> 00:56:48,446
I really don't know how much more right
she has to be.

664
00:56:48,530 --> 00:56:50,156
We haven't reached the lighthouse.

665
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:53,159
We still don't understand the cause
or the nature of the Shimmer.

666
00:56:53,243 --> 00:56:55,703
We have data, observations, photographs.
She has hella footage.

667
00:56:55,787 --> 00:56:59,499
All of which makes the phenomenon
less explicable, not more.

668
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:03,753
I'm gonna get to the lighthouse,

669
00:57:03,837 --> 00:57:05,755
and I'm fine going on my own.

670
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:10,093
You just need to decide...
whether you're coming with me or not.

671
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:24,315
It's like she hasn't noticed
that Sheppard is dead.

672
00:57:24,399 --> 00:57:25,567
She's crazy.

673
00:57:25,775 --> 00:57:27,569
She's a crazy old bitch.

674
00:57:28,736 --> 00:57:31,281
You know,
and thanks for the fucking backup, Lena.

675
00:57:32,574 --> 00:57:34,742
-I didn't realize there were sides.
 Yeah.

676
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:36,077
Yeah, there are sides.

677
00:57:37,370 --> 00:57:40,206
Okay, then I agree with you.
We should go back.

678
00:57:41,082 --> 00:57:43,126
Good. Okay, great. There we go. Okay?

679
00:57:43,209 --> 00:57:45,503
-So the three of us can--
 Hold on a minute.

680
00:57:45,587 --> 00:57:46,963
We should go back, yes.

681
00:57:47,046 --> 00:57:49,215
But it took us, what,
six days to get here?

682
00:57:49,591 --> 00:57:51,926
And the coast is two days away.

683
00:57:52,927 --> 00:57:55,346
And as Sheppard said...

684
00:57:56,347 --> 00:57:59,726
when we get to the coast,
we can follow it until the perimeter wall.

685
00:58:00,185 --> 00:58:01,936
You're saying we get out
by going deeper?

686
00:58:02,687 --> 00:58:04,689
-Yeah, if you like, yeah.

687
00:58:05,064 --> 00:58:07,692
No, I don't fucking "like."

688
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:14,782
This isn't some bullshit tactic
to get us to the lighthouse, is it?

689
00:58:14,866 --> 00:58:17,202
This is not about the lighthouse, okay?

690
00:58:17,994 --> 00:58:20,038
I believe that the coast
is the best route out.

691
00:58:24,834 --> 00:58:25,668
Okay?

692
00:58:39,224 --> 00:58:40,225
You lied to them.

693
00:58:43,645 --> 00:58:45,688
I didn't know what going back meant.

694
00:58:46,397 --> 00:58:48,858
Why it would be safer than going forward.

695
00:58:50,109 --> 00:58:53,780
You didn't know, but you made
a decision to continue as if you did.

696
00:58:53,947 --> 00:58:55,281
Ventress made the decision.

697
00:58:55,365 --> 00:58:58,159
Ventress had cancer.
She was never coming back.

698
00:58:59,494 --> 00:59:00,828
You knew she was sick.

699
00:59:01,746 --> 00:59:02,664
I had guessed.

700
00:59:06,084 --> 00:59:07,710
And you wanted to continue.

701
00:59:09,963 --> 00:59:10,797
Yes. I did.

702
01:00:00,346 --> 01:00:01,889
She could still be alive.

703
01:00:01,973 --> 01:00:03,433
It's highly doubtful.

704
01:00:05,226 --> 01:00:06,269
We need to know.

705
01:00:09,355 --> 01:00:10,189
Go. Fine.

706
01:00:14,819 --> 01:00:15,695
I'm coming with you.

707
01:00:17,322 --> 01:00:18,197
I'll go alone.

708
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:48,473
Did you find her?

709
01:02:49,307 --> 01:02:50,141
Yeah.

710
01:02:51,642 --> 01:02:52,477
She's dead.

711
01:03:17,502 --> 01:03:18,419
You okay?

712
01:03:19,420 --> 01:03:22,632
Fine. Just... leave me the fuck alone.

713
01:03:49,075 --> 01:03:50,827
We'll camp here tonight.

714
01:03:51,911 --> 01:03:54,121
It's another two hours' walk up the coast.

715
01:04:32,159 --> 01:04:33,744
They've grown this way.

716
01:04:34,787 --> 01:04:36,247
That doesn't make any sense.

717
01:04:37,081 --> 01:04:38,249
I think it does.

718
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:51,137
At first I thought the radio waves
were blocked by the Shimmer,

719
01:04:51,220 --> 01:04:55,349
and that's why no one inside
could communicate with base or GPS,

720
01:04:55,433 --> 01:05:00,688
but the light waves aren't blocked,
they're refracted, and...

721
01:05:05,484 --> 01:05:07,278
...it's the same with the radios.

722
01:05:07,987 --> 01:05:09,488
The signals aren't gone.

723
01:05:10,072 --> 01:05:11,407
They're scrambled.

724
01:05:17,663 --> 01:05:19,165
That leaf in your hand...

725
01:05:20,374 --> 01:05:22,168
know what you'd get if you sequenced it?

726
01:05:23,085 --> 01:05:25,379
-Human Hox genes.

727
01:05:25,463 --> 01:05:27,006
Hox

728
01:05:27,882 --> 01:05:31,928
They're the genes that define
the body plan, the physical structure.

729
01:05:34,096 --> 01:05:36,223
And the plants have human body plan.

730
01:05:36,307 --> 01:05:40,770
Arms attached to shoulders. Legs to hips.

731
01:05:40,853 --> 01:05:42,480
It's literally not possible. It's literally what's happening.

732
01:05:46,984 --> 01:05:50,655
The Shimmer is a prism,
but it refracts everything.

733
01:05:51,489 --> 01:05:53,866
Not just light and radio waves.

734
01:05:54,450 --> 01:05:57,620
Animal DNA, plant DNA...

735
01:05:58,704 --> 01:06:00,039
all DNA.

736
01:06:00,539 --> 01:06:01,958
What do you mean, "all DNA"?

737
01:06:02,875 --> 01:06:04,627
She's talking about our DNA.

738
01:06:07,505 --> 01:06:08,881
She's talking about us.

739
01:07:15,531 --> 01:07:18,159
All right... I guess this is a bedroom.

740
01:07:19,702 --> 01:07:21,537
Let's secure doors and windows.

741
01:08:47,289 --> 01:08:48,999
This was a mistake.

742
01:08:51,293 --> 01:08:52,128
Okay.

743
01:08:58,926 --> 01:09:01,554
You spend more time
away from your husband than with him.

744
01:09:03,639 --> 01:09:06,892
You can't talk to him about work,
and he won't talk to you about his.

745
01:09:06,976 --> 01:09:10,980
And there is a clear physical
and intellectual connection between us.

746
01:09:11,063 --> 01:09:13,149
-You forgot your wife.

747
01:09:13,232 --> 01:09:14,441
I love my wife.

748
01:09:17,319 --> 01:09:18,737
She's blameless in this.

749
01:09:27,329 --> 01:09:28,205
Come on, Lena.

750
01:09:29,957 --> 01:09:31,584
What's really going on here?

751
01:09:33,669 --> 01:09:36,005
You think that something
may have happened to him?

752
01:09:41,051 --> 01:09:42,386
Or you think he knows.

753
01:09:45,264 --> 01:09:46,307
That's it, isn't it?

754
01:09:47,266 --> 01:09:49,894
You think somehow he's found out
about our affair.

755
01:09:52,104 --> 01:09:53,147
Has he found out?

756
01:09:54,481 --> 01:09:55,316
Yes.

757
01:09:59,069 --> 01:09:59,945
You should go.

758
01:10:02,448 --> 01:10:03,866
-No, Lena, I--
-Dan...

759
01:10:04,867 --> 01:10:08,829
I'm not interested in talking...
or in anything you have to say.

760
01:10:10,039 --> 01:10:11,540
Just get dressed and get out.

761
01:10:14,376 --> 01:10:17,046
You know, it's not me you hate,
it's yourself.

762
01:10:20,507 --> 01:10:21,967
No, Dan, it's you, too.

763
01:10:26,138 --> 01:10:27,640
It's never gonna happen again. You lying bitch!

764
01:10:36,815 --> 01:10:38,525
-No.

765
01:10:39,276 --> 01:10:42,196
You don't get to ask
that fucking question. You answer it!

766
01:11:11,725 --> 01:11:12,559
Brother. Boyfriend.

767
01:11:17,982 --> 01:11:18,816
Husband.

768
01:11:22,903 --> 01:11:24,113
Husband.

769
01:11:26,365 --> 01:11:29,326
Why didn't you tell us?

770
01:11:30,661 --> 01:11:33,789
-You knew. Obviously.

771
01:11:42,589 --> 01:11:44,508
-Okay.

772
01:11:49,221 --> 01:11:51,265
There are two theories
of what went wrong.

773
01:11:51,348 --> 01:11:52,975
One is that something in here killed them.

774
01:11:53,058 --> 01:11:56,895
Two... is that they went crazy
and they killed each other.

775
01:11:58,731 --> 01:12:00,899
Josie nearly got killed by an alligator,

776
01:12:00,983 --> 01:12:03,610
and Cass did get killed by a bear.

777
01:12:06,113 --> 01:12:08,198
So, yes, theory one, it fits.

778
01:12:11,452 --> 01:12:12,286
But...

779
01:12:15,247 --> 01:12:16,957
I didn't actually see a bear.

780
01:12:18,459 --> 01:12:19,626
And neither did Josie.

781
01:12:20,794 --> 01:12:22,921
The only people who saw
were Lena and Ventress.

782
01:12:23,464 --> 01:12:26,175
So nothing's confirmed.
Everything's on their word.

783
01:12:26,550 --> 01:12:30,888
-Everything's on Lena's word.

784
01:12:31,263 --> 01:12:32,681
And what we know now...

785
01:12:34,141 --> 01:12:37,019
what we know,

786
01:12:37,394 --> 01:12:40,647
is that Lena... is a liar.

787
01:12:40,731 --> 01:12:42,816
-Shut the fuck up!

788
01:12:44,485 --> 01:12:48,155
Lena... you're a liar.

789
01:12:51,241 --> 01:12:52,076
Did you kill Cass?

790
01:12:54,995 --> 01:12:56,372
Did you lose your shit?

791
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:02,419
Or do you think I've lost my shit
and we're gonna fuck each other up?

792
01:13:02,503 --> 01:13:03,837
That's theory two.

793
01:13:09,635 --> 01:13:10,844
Oh, God.

794
01:13:15,641 --> 01:13:17,309
When I look at my hands...

795
01:13:18,310 --> 01:13:19,728
and my fingerprints...

796
01:13:21,438 --> 01:13:22,564
I can see them moving.

797
01:13:26,110 --> 01:13:29,238
I can't.

798
01:13:30,114 --> 01:13:31,615
If I let you go,

799
01:13:32,074 --> 01:13:34,743
and you tie me to a chair
and cut me open...

800
01:13:36,495 --> 01:13:39,957
are my insides gonna move
like my fingerprints?

801
01:13:47,381 --> 01:13:51,218
But... I'm not the one tied to a chair.

802
01:13:55,431 --> 01:13:56,598
-You are.

803
01:14:01,353 --> 01:14:03,313
Help me!

804
01:14:06,150 --> 01:14:07,359
Help me!

805
01:14:07,901 --> 01:14:09,278
Help me!

806
01:14:09,778 --> 01:14:11,321
Oh, Cass?

807
01:14:14,366 --> 01:14:16,785
-You said she was dead.

808
01:14:16,994 --> 01:14:19,455
Cass! Cass, I'm coming!

809
01:14:21,457 --> 01:14:23,750
Cass, is that you

810
01:15:06,877 --> 01:15:11,840
Help me! Help me!

811
01:15:12,674 --> 01:15:15,010
Help!

812
01:15:29,608 --> 01:15:30,651
Don't react.

813
01:15:31,443 --> 01:15:32,444
Mmm.

814
01:15:38,283 --> 01:15:41,328
Me!

815
01:16:07,646 --> 01:16:11,525
Help!

816
01:16:24,037 --> 01:16:25,622
Me!

817
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:38,677
No! No!

818
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:40,095
No!

819
01:16:58,196 --> 01:17:00,907
Me!

820
01:17:14,546 --> 01:17:18,550
Help... me...

821
01:17:42,366 --> 01:17:43,825
What are you doing?

822
01:17:44,201 --> 01:17:46,203
-I'm leaving.
 Now?

823
01:17:48,580 --> 01:17:51,208
-It's not even light yet.
-I don't have time to wait.

824
01:17:51,625 --> 01:17:53,251
We are disintegrating.

825
01:17:53,335 --> 01:17:55,420
Our bodies as fast as our minds.
Can't you feel it?

826
01:17:57,130 --> 01:17:59,049
It's like the onset of dementia.

827
01:18:02,094 --> 01:18:03,762
If I don't reach the lighthouse soon...

828
01:18:04,471 --> 01:18:07,891
the person that started this journey
won't be the person that ends it.

829
01:18:08,225 --> 01:18:10,102
I want to be the one that ends it.

830
01:19:12,497 --> 01:19:13,874
We should go, Josie.

831
01:19:21,923 --> 01:19:24,092
How long was your husband in the Shimmer?

832
01:19:26,219 --> 01:19:28,096
It's hard to say exactly.

833
01:19:31,099 --> 01:19:33,143
Theoretically, as long as a year.

834
01:19:35,645 --> 01:19:38,940
That's a long time to be inside
and remain intact.

835
01:19:39,816 --> 01:19:41,651
I'm not so sure he was intact.

836
01:19:45,989 --> 01:19:46,907
I'm right...

837
01:19:48,366 --> 01:19:52,204
-Yeah.

838
01:19:52,829 --> 01:19:54,664
I checked my blood last night.

839
01:19:57,292 --> 01:19:59,461
It's... in me.

840
01:20:02,631 --> 01:20:04,674
It will be in all of us.

841
01:20:11,056 --> 01:20:12,891
It was so strange hearing...

842
01:20:13,767 --> 01:20:17,062
Sheppard's voice in the mouth
of that creature last night.

843
01:20:18,396 --> 01:20:21,483
I think as she was dying,
part of her mind became...

844
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:24,528
part of the creature that was killing her.

845
01:20:26,738 --> 01:20:29,407
Imagine dying frightened and in pain,

846
01:20:29,491 --> 01:20:32,744
and having that as the only part of you
which survives.

847
01:20:34,204 --> 01:20:35,872
I wouldn't like that at all. Ventress wants to face it.

848
01:20:59,229 --> 01:21:00,480
You want to fight it.

849
01:21:02,274 --> 01:21:05,110
But I don't think I want
either of those things.

850
01:21:12,534 --> 01:21:13,368
Josie. Josie.

851
01:21:26,798 --> 01:21:27,757
Josie!

852
01:21:54,117 --> 01:21:58,079
One by one, all gone, except you.

853
01:22:00,290 --> 01:22:01,583
How do you explain that?

854
01:22:05,712 --> 01:22:07,714
Is it something I need to explain?

855
01:22:08,590 --> 01:22:09,883
Yes, you do.

856
01:22:16,598 --> 01:22:17,724
I had to come back.

857
01:22:19,809 --> 01:22:21,561
I'm not sure any of them did.

880
01:29:06,299 --> 01:29:07,342
<i>I will.</i>

881
01:29:08,509 --> 01:29:09,344
No.

882
01:29:12,138 --> 01:29:17,268
<i>Five, four, three, two...</i>

883
01:29:35,036 --> 01:29:37,538
No, no, no.<i> </i>No.

884
01:29:40,583 --> 01:29:44,128
Oh. Oh, God. Oh, my God.

885
01:29:44,712 --> 01:29:45,546
No.

886
01:31:10,923 --> 01:31:13,092
It's the last phase.

887
01:31:14,969 --> 01:31:17,013
Vanished into havoc.

888
01:31:20,475 --> 01:31:23,519
Unfathomable mind...

889
01:31:27,064 --> 01:31:29,192
...and now beacon.

890
01:31:29,984 --> 01:31:31,611
Now sea.

891
01:31:42,330 --> 01:31:43,247
Lena.

892
01:31:50,963 --> 01:31:52,215
We spoke.

893
01:31:53,883 --> 01:31:55,426
What was it we said?

894
01:32:01,140 --> 01:32:05,728
That I needed to know
what was inside the lighthouse.

895
01:32:08,648 --> 01:32:09,941
That moment's passed.

896
01:32:13,903 --> 01:32:15,655
It's inside me now.

897
01:32:17,073 --> 01:32:19,116
What's... inside you?

898
01:32:20,326 --> 01:32:21,702
It's not like us.

899
01:32:22,828 --> 01:32:24,664
It's unlike us.

900
01:32:27,917 --> 01:32:29,544
I don't know what it wants.

901
01:32:30,294 --> 01:32:31,546
Or if it wants.

902
01:32:32,630 --> 01:32:33,965
But it will grow...

903
01:32:34,423 --> 01:32:36,467
until it encompasses everything.

904
01:32:39,637 --> 01:32:40,721
Our bodies and our minds

905
01:32:40,805 --> 01:32:44,016
will be fragmented
into their smallest parts until...

906
01:32:44,850 --> 01:32:46,936
not one part remains.

907
01:32:51,566 --> 01:32:53,025
Annihilation.

908
01:35:47,533 --> 01:35:49,744
No, no, no. No!

909
01:44:12,204 --> 01:44:13,538
So it was alien.

910
01:44:20,671 --> 01:44:22,214
Can you describe its form?

911
01:44:27,094 --> 01:44:27,970
No.

912
01:44:28,971 --> 01:44:30,681
Was it carbon

913
01:44:34,726 --> 01:44:35,560
I don't know.

914
01:44:38,480 --> 01:44:39,731
What did it want?

915
01:44:41,400 --> 01:44:43,402
I don't think it wanted anything.

916
01:44:43,860 --> 01:44:46,405
But it... it attacked you.

917
01:44:47,322 --> 01:44:48,699
It mirrored me.

918
01:44:49,700 --> 01:44:50,784
I attacked it.

919
01:44:52,411 --> 01:44:54,454
I'm not sure it even knew I was there.

920
01:44:54,538 --> 01:44:56,164
It came here for a reason.

921
01:44:57,541 --> 01:45:01,211
It was mutating our environment,
it was destroying everything.

922
01:45:02,504 --> 01:45:04,506
It wasn't destroying. It was changing everything.

923
01:45:08,885 --> 01:45:10,887
It was making something new.

924
01:45:14,016 --> 01:45:14,975
Making what?

925
01:45:23,275 --> 01:45:24,192
I don't know.

926
01:45:28,739 --> 01:45:31,450
A team reached the lighthouse
a few hours ago.

927
01:45:32,659 --> 01:45:34,244
Everything is ash.

928
01:45:34,953 --> 01:45:38,123
If what you encountered was once alive...

929
01:45:38,957 --> 01:45:40,334
it seems it's now dead.

930
01:46:02,272 --> 01:46:04,816
Now will you tell me what happened
to my husband?

931
01:46:06,568 --> 01:46:08,236
<i>When the Shimmer disappeared,</i>

932
01:46:08,320 --> 01:46:12,366
<i>his blood pressure stabilized</i>
<i>and his pulse rate started to rise.</i>

933
01:46:13,867 --> 01:46:15,994
<i>A few hours later, he was not only awake,</i>

934
01:46:16,078 --> 01:46:17,162
<i>he was lucid.</i>

935
01:46:18,830 --> 01:46:20,916
<i>He's still in isolation, obviously.</i>

936
01:46:22,376 --> 01:46:23,377
<i>So am I.</i>

937
01:47:07,546 --> 01:47:08,672
You aren't Kane...

938
01:47:10,507 --> 01:47:11,425
are you?

939
01:47:18,056 --> 01:47:19,182
I don't think so.

940
01:47:27,607 --> 01:47:28,692
Are you Lena?
