What did you eat?

4
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:10,237
You had rations for two weeks.

5
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,281
You were inside for nearly four months.

6
00:01:13,282 --> 00:01:14,741
I don't remember eating.

7
00:01:17,953 --> 00:01:19,913
How long did you think you were inside?

8
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:23,250
Days.

00:01:24,668 --> 00:01:25,794
Maybe weeks.

[woman] This is a cell.

18
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:04,476
Like all cells,
it is born from an existing cell.

19
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,395
And by extension,

20
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:09,856
all cells were ultimately born
from one cell.

21
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:14,319
A single organism alone on planet Earth,

22
00:03:14,403 --> 00:03:16,071
perhaps alone in the universe.

23
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:18,532
About four billion years ago...

24
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:21,952
one became two, two became four.

25
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:25,914
Then eight, 16, 32.

26
00:03:26,832 --> 00:03:28,917
The rhythm of the dividing pair...

27
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:34,464
which becomes the structure
of every microbe,

28
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:37,300
blade of grass, sea creature,
land creature...

29
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:38,885
and human.

30
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:42,013
The structure of everything that lives...

31
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:45,308
and everything that dies.

32
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:49,438
As students of medicine,
as the doctors of tomorrow,

33
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:50,939
this is where you come in.

34
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:55,736
The cell we're looking at is from a tumor.

35
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:59,406
Female patient, early 30s,
taken from the cervix.

36
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:01,199
Over the course of the next term,

37
00:04:01,283 --> 00:04:04,119
we will be closely examining cancer cells
in vitro

38
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:06,163
and discussing autophagic activity.

39

- Professor?
- [woman] Hey, Katie.

40
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:11,418
[Katie] I read the John Sulston paper
last night.

41
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:13,295
I still feel like
I'm not working hard enough.

42
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:14,921
I'm behind the other students.

43
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:17,674
- They find everything easier.
- [woman] You aren't, and they don't.

44
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:18,800

Dan.

46
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:25,682
[Dan] I've been looking for you at lunch,
but you never seem to be around.

47
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:28,018
I've been catching up on some writing.

48
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:31,313
All work and no play, it sounds...
not healthy.

49
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,858
I wanted to ask,

50
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:37,319
- do you have plans Saturday?
- [clicks tongue]

51

Sarah and I have a few people over.

52
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:41,907
A garden party while the weather holds.

53
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:45,202
Actually, I do have plans.

54
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:46,828
I think it'll be fun.

55
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:50,373
Thanks, Dan, I really appreciate it,
but I'm going to paint our bedr...

56

The bedroom.

57
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:55,921
It's been a year, Lena.

58
00:04:59,174 --> 00:05:02,344
You're allowed to come to a barbecue.
It is not a betrayal

59
00:05:02,928 --> 00:05:04,596
or an insult to his memory.

60

00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,076
Am I in a psychiatric hospital?

167
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:07,203
- No.
- [Lena] Then what?

168
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:08,871
Where am I?

169
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:11,541
Where's my husband?

170
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:14,502
You served in the military
for seven years.

171
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:18,840
I'm a professor from Johns Hopkins.

172
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:21,426
I want to know what the fuck
I'm doing here.

173
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:26,055
Your research area is the genetically
programmed life cycle of a cell.

174
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:27,557
Where is my husband?

175
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,601
Yeah,
I'd like to talk about Sergeant Kane.

176
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:33,980
When did he arrive back home?

177
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:39,527
- I want to see a lawyer.
- You're not gonna be able to.

178
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:46,534
Did he explain how he got back?

179
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:51,122
- No.
- Did he contact you at any point

180
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:52,290
while he was away?

181
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:53,833
No.

182
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:58,004
[Ventress] What did he tell you
about his mission when he returned?

183
00:13:59,047 --> 00:14:00,923
- Nothing.
- What about before he left?

184
00:14:01,299 --> 00:14:03,885
Did he ever mention where he was going,
what he was doing?

185
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,762
He never said, I never asked.

186
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:10,558
But you made regular requests
for information from his unit CO.

187
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:13,895
Until six months ago,
and then you stopped.

188
00:14:16,731 --> 00:14:19,275
Why was that? Thought he was dead?

189
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:20,818
Time to move on?

190
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:24,489
It's not easy to move on.

191
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:27,408
I didn't.

192
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:37,835
I'm done answering questions.
It's your turn.

193
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:40,922
Your husband's here.

194
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:44,258
He's extremely ill.

195
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:47,178
- In what way?
- [Ventress] Multiple organ failure.

196
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:50,431
Massive internal bleeding.

197
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:55,103
He must have been exposed
to some sort of radiation,

198
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:57,355
some kind of virus.

199
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,400
You have to tell me where he was,
what he was doing.

200
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:05,363
I could actually help him.

201
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,926
[wind whipping]

202
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:34,308
[crackling]

203
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:51,492
[Ventress] <i>A religious event.</i>

204
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:54,579
<i>An extraterrestrial event.</i>

205
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:57,165
<i>A higher dimension.</i>

206
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,667
We have many theories,

207
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:01,252
few facts.

208
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:04,464
It started around three years ago.

209
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:08,551
Blackwater National Park reported
that a lighthouse was surrounded

210
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:11,304
by something they termed "a shimmer."

211
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:15,516
One of the wardens went in to investigate.

212
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:17,602
Never returned.

213
00:16:18,853 --> 00:16:20,396
The event was classified.

214
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:23,441
Since then, we've approached by land,
by sea,

215
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:26,903
sent in drones, animals,
and teams of people.

216
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:29,447
But nothing comes back.

217
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:32,950
And the boundary's getting bigger.
It's expanding.

218
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:35,745
So far, it's eating
into barely populated swampland,

219
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:40,291
which, you know, we evacuated
under the pretext of a chemical spill,

220
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:43,044
but... that won't last much longer.

221
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:48,841
In a few months, the area will have grown
to where we are right now.

222
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:54,138
And then we're talking cities...

223
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:56,182
states...

224
00:16:57,975 --> 00:16:59,185
and so on.

225
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:03,189
You said nothing comes back.

226
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:05,858
But something has.

227
00:17:07,944 --> 00:17:08,778
Yes.

228
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:12,532
- [breathing deeply]
- [monitors beeping]

229
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:18,579
[Lena] He's dying.

230
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:21,457
[Ventress] Yes.

231
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:28,089
We need to come to an agreement
about what to do with you.

232
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:30,216
You're not going to let me go home?

233
00:17:34,095 --> 00:17:36,556
Is that what you want? To go home?

234
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:41,644
No.

235
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:44,313
I want to be with him.

236
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:04,834
You're not talking to me.

237
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:07,837
Sorry.

238
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:10,506
Zoned out.

239
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:13,884
Thinking about the next mission?

240
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:17,471
No.

241
00:18:18,681 --> 00:18:20,266
I was just looking at the moon.

242
00:18:22,977 --> 00:18:25,771
It's always so weird seeing it like that
in the daylight.

243
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:27,815
Like God made a mistake.

244
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:29,775
- [chuckles]
- Left the hall lights on.

245
00:18:30,026 --> 00:18:31,861
God doesn't make mistakes. That's...

246
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:34,864
somewhat key
to the whole "being a god" thing.

247
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:38,200
Pretty sure he does.

248
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:41,746
You know he's listening right now,
don't you?

249
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:44,665
You take a cell,

250
00:18:44,749 --> 00:18:47,418
circumvent the Hayflick limit,
you can prevent senescence.

251
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:51,172
I was about to make the exact same point.

252
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:54,300
It means the cell doesn't grow old,
it becomes immortal.

253
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:55,593
Keeps dividing, doesn't die.

254
00:18:58,721 --> 00:19:02,933
They say aging is a natural process,
but it's actually a fault in our genes.

255
00:19:05,186 --> 00:19:07,647
I get really turned on
when you patronize me. It's really hot.

256
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:10,650
Without it,
I could keep looking like this forever.

257
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:11,859
Oh, okay.

258
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:14,236
- Well, that could constitute a mistake.
- [laughs]

259
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:22,495
You didn't tell me
where you're heading this time.

260
00:19:24,455 --> 00:19:27,583
I know there's something strange
about this mission.

261
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:32,171
Why?

262
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:36,842
The silence around it
is louder than usual.

263
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:41,931
Kind of angling for a clue here.

264
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:47,269
So...?

265
00:19:51,816 --> 00:19:53,359
We'll be under the same hemisphere.

266
00:19:55,653 --> 00:19:56,779
What does that tell me?

267
00:19:58,823 --> 00:20:01,659
It tells you that if you step outside
and you look up...

268
00:20:03,494 --> 00:20:04,995
we'll be looking at the same stars.

269
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:07,498
- Holy fucking shit.
- What?

270
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:09,208
- Are you kidding?
- What?

271
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,293
You think that's what I do
while you're away?

272
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:15,047
- What?
- You think I'm out in the garden,

273
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:16,841
pining, looking up at the sky?

274
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:21,804
- [scoffs] Shut up. All right.
- Oh, to think my beloved Kane...

275
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:25,391
- Okay. Uh-huh.
- ...is looking at the selfsame moon.

276
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:26,976
[chuckling] Stop it.

277
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:30,563
[laughing] Oh,
my distant celestial friend...

278
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:32,773
No. No.

279
00:20:33,107 --> 00:20:35,401
...please care for my brave soldier.

280
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:37,403
Jesus. You know what?
You are disrespectful,

281
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:40,197
seriously, not only to your former
comrades in the armed forces,

282
00:20:40,281 --> 00:20:42,408
- but also to the president.
- You forgot the flag.

283
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:45,286
Oh, I'm getting...
I'm getting to the motherfucking flag.

284
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:46,412
Oh, my hero.

285
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:48,205
- Screw you.
- Okay.

286
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:55,045
[crackling]

287
00:20:55,129 --> 00:20:57,173
- [indistinct chatter]
- [woman laughs]

288
00:20:58,591 --> 00:21:01,802
[woman] She's all by herself.
Don't you think we should make friends?

289
00:21:01,886 --> 00:21:04,722
- [woman 2] Well, obviously <i>you</i> should.
- [woman] Yep, I'll do it.

290
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:09,477
Hey.

291
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:11,187
Hey.

292
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,647
- Am I intruding?
- No, not at all.

293
00:21:14,857 --> 00:21:16,734
Cool. Phew. [chuckles]

294
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:19,236
You know, I always see you here alone.
It's...

295
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:24,575
I'm guessing you probably feel weird
or awkward.

296
00:21:26,202 --> 00:21:27,661
Somewhat, I guess.

297
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:31,499
Don't. Seriously, don't.

298
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:35,085
The people here put themselves to sleep
in the fetal position

299
00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:36,462
making cooing noises.

300
00:21:37,338 --> 00:21:39,173
It's freaky, you know. [chuckles]

301
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:42,676
- I'm Anya.
- Lena.

302
00:21:43,177 --> 00:21:44,970
- Nice to meet you.
- You, too.

303
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:48,182
Um, why don't you come and meet my crew?

304
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:50,059
Come make friends. Come on.

305
00:21:51,894 --> 00:21:54,188
Ladies, meet Lena.

306
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:56,273
[Lena and woman] Hi nice to meet you.

307
00:21:56,357 --> 00:21:59,193
Yeah, that's Cassie Sheppard,
and Josie Radek.

308
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:00,986
- [Lena] Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

309
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:03,781
- [Cassie] Do you want to have a seat?
- Thank you.

310
00:22:03,906 --> 00:22:07,159
- So, first day at the Southern Reach.
- Yes.

311
00:22:07,493 --> 00:22:08,744
- Ah!
- [bottle cap clatters]

312
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:10,287
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

313
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,540
You all been here long?

314
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:15,543
Um, yeah, right from the start.

315
00:22:15,626 --> 00:22:17,086
I'm a geomorphologist.

316
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:20,256
I've been testing the magnetic fields
around the boundary,

317
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:23,634
which is like using confetti
to test a hurricane.

318
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:27,888
Uh, and I've been here... ten months.

319
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:29,598
Wow, ten months.

320
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:31,141
Paramedic from Chicago.

321
00:22:31,225 --> 00:22:33,310
Tried to join an NGO,
but my applicationgot flagged,

322
00:22:33,394 --> 00:22:34,645
so Southern Reach got me.

323
00:22:34,979 --> 00:22:37,189
Only two months. I'm a physicist.

324
00:22:37,273 --> 00:22:39,733
I came straight from my Cambridge postdoc.

325
00:22:40,401 --> 00:22:41,819
[Cassie] She's very smart.

326
00:22:42,528 --> 00:22:44,196
What's your story, Lena?

327
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:46,740
Uh, I'm from Johns Hopkins, biologist.

328
00:22:46,824 --> 00:22:48,492
- Oh, there you go.
- Ha, biologist?

329
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:50,119
- Told you she was smart.
- [Anya] What?

330
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:53,455
We had a bet on your profession,
and Josie had biologist, of course.

331
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:55,624
- [Anya chuckles, sighs]
- [chuckles]

332
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:58,502
- I had law enforcement.
- I had you as single.

333
00:22:58,586 --> 00:23:01,255
Jesus. Do you have to hit
on everyone, like all the time?

334
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:02,923
Fuck that. Under the circumstances,

335
00:23:03,007 --> 00:23:05,926
I think I'm allowed to roll the dice
a few more times. [chuckles]

336
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:07,970
Under what circumstances?

337
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:13,893
Well, yeah, um, crazy as it seems...

338
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:16,061
Crazy as it <i>is.</i>

339
00:23:18,772 --> 00:23:20,482
...we are headed that way.

340
00:23:25,738 --> 00:23:28,365
- You're going into the Shimmer?
- Six days and counting.

341
00:23:30,451 --> 00:23:32,077
- You three?
- Four.

342
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:33,662
Ventress.

343
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:38,083
- Dr. Ventress?
- [Cassie] Mmm. Team leader.

344
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,337
- All women.
- Scientists.

345
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:44,965
The previous teams
have been largely military, so, yeah.

346
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:47,760
What do you think happened to them?

347
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:51,555
Well, there are two theories
of what went wrong in the Shimmer.

348
00:23:52,181 --> 00:23:54,183
One, something kills them.

349
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:56,852
Two, they go crazy and kill each other.

350
00:23:58,604 --> 00:24:00,856
[Josie] There was one military guy
who made it out.

351
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:01,774
[Cassie] Yeah.

352
00:24:02,358 --> 00:24:03,192
A sergeant.

353
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:05,486
Yeah, but you heard
about the state that he was in.

354
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:14,870
[breathing deeply]

355
00:24:53,701 --> 00:24:54,702
[whispering] Kane...

356
00:24:57,663 --> 00:24:59,540
I know why you went in.

357
00:25:08,716 --> 00:25:10,092
I am so sorry.

358
00:25:12,845 --> 00:25:14,847
And I know what I have to do.

359
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:22,021
[Ventress] <i>So you didn't tell them
about your connection to Sergeant Kane?</i>

360
00:25:22,438 --> 00:25:25,107
[Lena]
I thought it would complicate things.

361
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:27,026
What?

362
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:29,445
What would it complicate?

363
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:38,495
Why are you going into the Shimmer?

364
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:45,127
The mission statement is to reach
the supposed source of the Shimmer,

365
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:49,882
the lighthouse,
enter and acquire data, and return.

366
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:54,887
But I don't think that
that's your mission statement.

367
00:26:00,184 --> 00:26:01,018
No.

368
00:26:09,485 --> 00:26:12,654
I've been watching the phenomenon
for a while now.

369
00:26:13,614 --> 00:26:16,241
I profile the volunteers.

370
00:26:17,201 --> 00:26:19,453
I pick the teams.

371
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:24,500
They enter, I watch.

372
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,004
I watch it grow closer.

373
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:34,218
There's only so long one can do that.

374
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:38,138
But you need to know what's inside?

375
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:42,059
Yes, I do.

376
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:46,105
So do I.

377
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:49,108
So that's the complication.

378
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:52,111
You want to come with us.

379
00:26:53,487 --> 00:26:55,572
I can't do anything for him here.

380
00:26:57,324 --> 00:26:58,992
Soldier-scientist.

381
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,703
You can fight.

382
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:03,956
You can learn.

383
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,793
You can save him.

384
00:27:14,133 --> 00:27:16,260
You requested to join the mission.

385
00:27:16,802 --> 00:27:18,887
You knew all other missions had failed

386
00:27:18,971 --> 00:27:21,473
and the only survivor
was barely surviving.

387
00:27:22,683 --> 00:27:23,892
That was a brave choice.

388
00:27:25,102 --> 00:27:25,936
I owed him.

389
00:27:28,522 --> 00:27:30,899
I'm only trying to understand
what drove you.

390
00:27:34,236 --> 00:27:35,362
I owed him...

391
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,116
so I went in.

392
00:27:40,951 --> 00:27:42,953
- [wind whipping]
- [crackling]

393
00:27:48,709 --> 00:27:50,878
[helicopter blades whirring]

394
00:29:08,205 --> 00:29:10,207
[Lena panting]

395
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:23,762
[Lena gasps]

396
00:29:25,347 --> 00:29:26,556
[Lena moans]

397
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,726
- [raindrops pattering]
- [birds chirping]

398
00:30:10,434 --> 00:30:12,686
[birds calling]

399
00:30:23,989 --> 00:30:25,907
[Anya] And then we get some real meals.

400
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:29,786
Spaghetti.
Here's Radek's vegetable crackers.

401
00:30:32,164 --> 00:30:34,249
Wow, cornbread. That's not so bad.

402
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:36,043
Oh, you're finally awake.

403
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:39,838
You gotta give me a second.
I'm a little disoriented.

404
00:30:40,297 --> 00:30:41,590
Join the club.

405
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:44,217
You don't remember
setting up camp, do you?

406
00:30:46,345 --> 00:30:50,140
I don't remember anything...
after we reached the tree line.

407
00:30:51,475 --> 00:30:52,309
None of us do.

408
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:54,936
And we did a food inventory.

409
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:59,941
From the depletion, we've been out here
for at least three or four days.

410
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:02,486
That's not possible.

411
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:04,446
[Anya] That's what I said.

412
00:31:06,615 --> 00:31:11,203
Guys, I've been checking
my comms and nav equipment.

413
00:31:11,495 --> 00:31:13,622
They boot up fine,
no problem with the electronics,

414
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:15,123
and the camera is working,

415
00:31:15,207 --> 00:31:19,086
but anything that sends a signal
out of the Shimmer... is down.

416
00:31:19,795 --> 00:31:22,672
Even though we've probably got
about 20 satellites above us right now,

417
00:31:22,756 --> 00:31:24,966
and... check this out.

418
00:31:28,095 --> 00:31:32,474
So we've got no compass,
no comms, no coordinates...

419
00:31:33,392 --> 00:31:34,476
and no landmarks.

420
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,436
Well, we know we're in the state park.

421
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,896
We head south, we hit the ocean,

422
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:41,858
then we can just follow the shoreline
until we hit the perimeter wall. Right?

423
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:46,029
- How do we know what's south?
- Come on, Josie, you know this.

424
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:47,739
Hour hand at the sun.

425
00:31:49,116 --> 00:31:51,701
Split the difference
between the hour hand and 12, south.

426
00:31:52,828 --> 00:31:53,787
Good.

427
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:55,163
We're oriented.

428
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:59,167
We weren't really expecting
the comms equipment to work, were we?

429
00:31:59,501 --> 00:32:03,130
There's been three years of expeditions
and three years of radio silence.

430
00:32:04,131 --> 00:32:06,216
Let's pack up and get moving.

431
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:08,593
We've already lost a lot of the day.

432
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:12,324
[Anya] Oh, I'm gonna check this out.
Get us out of this damn swamp.

433
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:15,494
[Ventress] All right.
Let's check out the hut.

434
00:33:17,078 --> 00:33:18,163
[Anya sighs]

435
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:36,431
Looks like someone's
about to have a wedding.

436
00:33:39,184 --> 00:33:41,478
These are very strange.

437
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,104
Why?

438
00:33:45,232 --> 00:33:46,858
Well, they're all so different.

439
00:33:47,317 --> 00:33:50,779
To look at them, you wouldn't say
that they're the same species.

440
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:54,199
But they're growing
from the same branch structure...

441
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:57,494
so it has to be the same species.

442
00:33:58,161 --> 00:33:59,621
It's the same plant.

443
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:03,333
It's like they're stuck
in a continuous mutation.

444
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:04,668
A pathology?

445
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:06,878
[Lena] Yeah, well...

446
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:12,092
you'd sure as hell call it a pathology
if you saw this in a human.

447
00:34:22,936 --> 00:34:24,854
[Anya] Jackpot. [chuckles]

448
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:27,732
Sheppard! Mode of transportation.

449
00:34:32,946 --> 00:34:34,364
Anything interesting in there?

450
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:37,492
No. It's been long abandoned,
maybe even before...

451
00:34:37,576 --> 00:34:39,077
[shouts]

452
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,036
Radek?

453
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:42,497
Radek!

454
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:44,416
- [splashing]
- Radek!

455
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:45,709
[Josie] It's got my bag!

456
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:47,043
[Lena] Radek!

457
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:52,257
[gasps] Something's got my bag!

458
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:53,967
[shrieks] Oh, no!

459
00:34:54,676 --> 00:34:55,677
It's got my bag!

460
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:58,096
[screaming]

461
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:00,056
[both panting]

462
00:35:00,557 --> 00:35:02,809
- [Lena] Help me with her!
- [Anya] What's going on?

463
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:04,311
[all panting]

464
00:35:04,394 --> 00:35:05,854
[Anya] Hey, grab my shoulder!

465
00:35:06,563 --> 00:35:08,481
[Josie panting, coughing]

466
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:10,483
[Lena] Get her. Come on.

467
00:35:11,985 --> 00:35:13,069
[Anya] I got her.

468
00:35:13,278 --> 00:35:14,821
[Cassie] Okay? You got her?

469
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:16,281
[Anya] I got her. Okay.

470
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:17,407
You're good, you're good.

471
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:19,367
It's okay.

472
00:35:19,451 --> 00:35:20,410
[gasps]

473
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:26,124
[Josie hyperventilating]

474
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:28,668
[Anya] Let's sit you down.
Help me with her bag.

475
00:35:28,752 --> 00:35:31,129
Okay, just breathe.
It's okay. You're just fine.

476
00:35:31,212 --> 00:35:33,465
- What the hell happened?
- Something in the water.

477
00:35:34,049 --> 00:35:35,592
[banging]

478
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:38,720
[wood creaking]

479
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:40,555
[banging continues]

480
00:35:43,433 --> 00:35:44,851
[growls]

481
00:35:44,934 --> 00:35:46,770
- Get up, get up. Go.
- [gasping]

482
00:35:56,613 --> 00:35:58,323
Oh, shit! Get back.

483
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:00,533
[snarling]

484
00:36:03,036 --> 00:36:05,830
[Anya] Sheppard! Sheppard, watch out!

485
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:11,044
- [gun clicks]
- Holy fuck!

486
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:14,005
[roars]

487
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:20,178
[growls]

488
00:36:34,484 --> 00:36:37,654
[growls weakly]

489
00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:46,413
[Anya grunts]

490
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:53,461
Whoa.

491
00:36:55,422 --> 00:36:57,674
It's exactly the same as the flowers.

492
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:00,135
Look at the teeth.

493
00:37:01,553 --> 00:37:03,179
Concentric rows.

494
00:37:04,013 --> 00:37:06,933
Something here is making giant waves
in the gene pool.

495
00:37:07,517 --> 00:37:09,060
Sharks have teeth like that, don't they?

496
00:37:09,144 --> 00:37:11,146
Do you think it's a crossbreed?

497
00:37:12,522 --> 00:37:15,608
You can't crossbreed
between different species.

498
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:20,905
Lena, this is getting heavy.

499
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:22,615
[clears throat]

500
00:37:30,457 --> 00:37:33,001
The mutations were subtle at first.

501
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:37,505
More extreme as we grew closer
to the lighthouse.

502
00:37:39,048 --> 00:37:41,050
Corruptions of form.

503
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:44,179
Duplicates of form.

504
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:45,263
[man] Duplicates?

505
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:49,768
Echoes.

506
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:56,608
Is it possible these were hallucinations?

507
00:37:59,068 --> 00:38:01,070
I wondered that myself.

508
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:04,616
But they were shared among all of us.

509
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:08,661
It was dreamlike.

510
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:11,164
[man] Nightmarish.

511
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:13,166
Not always.

512
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:17,629
Sometimes it was beautiful.

513
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,947
Ow. [groans]

514
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:46,991
[Cassie] You hurt?

515
00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:49,202
It's just a bruise.

516
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:52,789
[clicks tongue]
Must have gotten that from the gator.

517
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:54,123
Yeah.

518
00:38:59,128 --> 00:39:01,172
So, where'd you learn to shoot?

519
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:05,844
I was in the military
before I was an academic.

520
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:07,846
Marines?

521
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:09,931
Army. Seven years.

522
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,684
Feels like a lifetime ago now.

523
00:39:12,934 --> 00:39:13,768
Yeah.

524
00:39:15,395 --> 00:39:17,814
All other lives feel like a lifetime ago.

525
00:39:18,398 --> 00:39:20,441
We were kids, I was married.

526
00:39:21,818 --> 00:39:25,238
Which do you carry around your neck?
A husband or a child?

527
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:26,656
Husband.

528
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:30,201
He was in the army, too. That's...

529
00:39:30,952 --> 00:39:32,036
That's how we met.

530
00:39:33,288 --> 00:39:34,581
"Was" in the army? He quit?

531
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:37,292
KIA.

532
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:40,628
I'm sorry to hear that.

533
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,007
Guess there had to be something.

534
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:45,508
What do you mean?

535
00:39:48,136 --> 00:39:50,638
Volunteering for... this.

536
00:39:50,722 --> 00:39:54,392
It's not exactly something you do
if your life is in... perfect harmony.

537
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:58,980
We're all damaged goods here.

538
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:01,065
Anya is sober...

539
00:40:01,858 --> 00:40:03,067
therefore an addict.

540
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:05,528
Josie wears long sleeves

541
00:40:05,612 --> 00:40:08,323
'cause she doesn't want you
to see the scars on her forearms.

542
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:10,074
She's tried to kill herself?

543
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:13,494
No, I think the opposite,
trying to feel alive.

544
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:17,498
Ventress?

545
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:21,252
Yeah. As far as anyone knows...

546
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:26,090
no friends, no family,
no partner, no children.

547
00:40:27,216 --> 00:40:29,010
No concession in her at all.

548
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:35,099
- You?
- I also lost someone.

549
00:40:37,936 --> 00:40:39,520
Not a husband, though, um...

550
00:40:39,938 --> 00:40:42,190
A daughter. Leukemia.

551
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:44,567
God, I'm sorry.

552
00:40:45,318 --> 00:40:46,986
In a way, it's two bereavements.

553
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:51,658
My... beautiful girl...

554
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:55,203
and the person I once was.

555
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:56,537
[Anya] Hey, hey!

556
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:58,831
We got something here.

557
00:41:30,363 --> 00:41:33,116
This used to be the headquarters
of the Southern Reach.

558
00:41:34,409 --> 00:41:35,952
Before the Shimmer swallowed it.

559
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:40,873
More mutations.

560
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,126
They're everywhere.

561
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:45,211
Malignant.

562
00:41:46,004 --> 00:41:47,463
Like tumors.

563
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,883
Is that the old mess hall?

564
00:41:51,092 --> 00:41:51,926
Yeah.

565
00:41:52,135 --> 00:41:54,470
Let's billet there. Come on.

566
00:42:13,823 --> 00:42:14,824
[door closes]

567
00:42:30,006 --> 00:42:32,884
There's beds and bags.
You think people are here?

568
00:42:34,052 --> 00:42:35,053
Were here.

569
00:42:36,179 --> 00:42:38,139
Yeah, I'm gonna go with the past tense.

570
00:42:58,910 --> 00:42:59,744
Damn.

571
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:04,499
Oh.

572
00:43:06,167 --> 00:43:07,460
Oh, shit.

573
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:14,884
[Anya grunts]

574
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:19,472
This shit is heavy. Can't carry this.

575
00:43:36,489 --> 00:43:37,657
Lena, what you got going on?

576
00:43:39,826 --> 00:43:41,077
Guys, check this out.

577
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:45,498
"Peyton, Mayer...

578
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:49,794
Kane, Shelley."

579
00:43:50,378 --> 00:43:52,547
Those were the soldiers
on the last expedition.

580
00:43:52,922 --> 00:43:55,758
Looks like they were using this room
as their base of operations.

581
00:43:55,842 --> 00:43:57,635
Why are some of the names crossed out?

582
00:43:57,718 --> 00:43:59,345
Let's not jump to conclusions.

583
00:43:59,428 --> 00:44:01,681
- I don't know, maybe we should.
- Yeah.

584
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:05,685
- This is a plan view of the base, right?
- [Cassie] Yep. This is the mess hall.

585
00:44:05,768 --> 00:44:07,103
- Building we're in?
- [Cassie] Yep.

586
00:44:07,186 --> 00:44:10,231
I think that the times by the names
are a guard rota, so...

587
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:12,692
if they were guarding the perimeter,
we should.

588
00:44:12,775 --> 00:44:14,443
- [Anya] Copy that.
- [Cassie] Yep.

589
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:29,876
This might be able to tell us something.

590
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:35,423
"For those that follow."

591
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:39,302
I believe that means us.

592
00:44:48,269 --> 00:44:49,312
Memory card.

593
00:44:52,064 --> 00:44:53,858
I should be able to play this.

594
00:44:57,653 --> 00:44:58,738
[camera beeps]

595
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:01,365
[whirrs]

596
00:45:01,449 --> 00:45:02,658
[Josie] It's working.

597
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:05,620
- [beeps]
- [splashing over speaker]

598
00:45:07,496 --> 00:45:08,623
[Kane] <i>All right?</i>

599
00:45:13,669 --> 00:45:15,421
- <i>Okay?</i>
- <i>Okay.</i>

600
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:16,714
<i>Okay.</i>

601
00:45:26,933 --> 00:45:28,976
[Kane] <i>Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.</i>

602
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:30,811
- [man] <i>Okay. Okay.</i>
- [Kane] <i>Yeah?</i>

603
00:45:30,895 --> 00:45:32,313
[man's voice quavers] <i>Okay.</i>

604
00:45:32,605 --> 00:45:35,316
[grunting, panting]

[man moans]

606
00:45:45,868 --> 00:45:46,869
Shit.

607
00:45:47,912 --> 00:45:49,080
What is he doing?

608
00:45:49,163 --> 00:45:51,165
[man continues moaning and panting]

609
00:45:57,255 --> 00:45:59,799
[man] <i>Stop. Stop. Stop, stop, stop.</i>

610
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:02,969
[Kane] <i>Hold him. Hold him down.</i>

611
00:46:03,302 --> 00:46:04,971
- [grunts]
- [man continues moaning]

612
00:46:05,054 --> 00:46:06,847
[Kane] <i>Oh, yeah. Yeah.</i>

613
00:46:06,931 --> 00:46:08,266
<i>There. There.</i>

614
00:46:24,991 --> 00:46:28,202
Okay, so we know what happened
to the last group. They went insane.

615
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:31,163
- Was something alive inside that man.
- No.

616
00:46:31,247 --> 00:46:33,332
- That was a trick of the light.
- [Cassie] What?

617
00:46:33,416 --> 00:46:36,377
[Anya] I've been a paramedic for 10 years.
I've scraped people off the road.

618
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:39,338
You see some weird shit.
That was a trick of the light.

619
00:46:39,422 --> 00:46:41,966
- [Josie] His insides were moving.
- [Anya] No, it was shock.

620
00:46:42,049 --> 00:46:44,176
- That was a shock response.
- [Cassie] Watch it again.

621
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:46,012
[Anya] No, I'm not gonna watch it again!

622
00:46:46,095 --> 00:46:48,055
[Cassie] That was not intestines.
It was a worm...

623
00:46:48,139 --> 00:46:50,224
[Anya] Okay, then you watch it, Sheppard!

624
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:55,646
[Cassie] Where are you going?

625
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:05,072
[panting]

626
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:11,620
- Where'd she go?
- Just ahead.

627
00:47:30,014 --> 00:47:32,016
[water splashing]

628
00:48:08,594 --> 00:48:09,428
What is it?

629
00:48:10,763 --> 00:48:11,889
I don't know.

630
00:48:29,824 --> 00:48:32,410
- I don't want to stay here tonight.
- We don't have a choice.

631
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:36,247
- [Josie] Please.
- Come on.

632
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:39,208
It's too late in the day
for us to move on.

633
00:48:39,542 --> 00:48:41,043
[Anya] Come on, let's go outside.

634
00:49:22,751 --> 00:49:24,879
Oh, that's nice of you.

635
00:49:27,548 --> 00:49:29,341
Why aren't you here?

636
00:49:31,594 --> 00:49:33,137
I gotta leave a day early.

637
00:49:33,888 --> 00:49:34,763
What?

638
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:37,391
Wait, today?

639
00:49:39,018 --> 00:49:41,228
- Right now.
- Oh, shit.

640
00:49:41,604 --> 00:49:43,147
But we had a whole day planned.

641
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:45,274
- We were gonna drive to the country...
- No, we can't.

642
00:49:46,192 --> 00:49:48,194
- We can't.
- Can you at least...?

643
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:55,117
Now means right now.

644
00:49:58,954 --> 00:49:59,788
Yeah.

645
00:50:03,334 --> 00:50:04,251
What is it?

646
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:12,593
I do...

647
00:50:16,639 --> 00:50:17,515
love you...

648
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:19,600
Lena.

649
00:50:22,061 --> 00:50:23,020
I love you, too.

650
00:51:20,411 --> 00:51:21,495
[Cassie, whispering] Hey.

651
00:51:23,539 --> 00:51:24,707
The mystery unraveling?

652
00:51:25,124 --> 00:51:26,083
[chuckles softly]

653
00:51:26,792 --> 00:51:28,460
[whispering] Something's unraveling.

654
00:51:29,628 --> 00:51:31,130
I think you're doing okay.

655
00:51:33,549 --> 00:51:35,050
It's good Josie's getting some rest.

656
00:51:35,134 --> 00:51:35,968
Yeah.

657
00:51:36,343 --> 00:51:38,220
With the help of a little sedative.

658
00:51:38,304 --> 00:51:40,723
How about you? Get some sleep?

659
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:42,433
Some.

660
00:51:43,559 --> 00:51:45,644
I'm at least as freaked as Josie.

661
00:51:47,354 --> 00:51:48,981
I'm just hiding it better.

662
00:51:52,901 --> 00:51:54,111
I should check on Ventress.

663
00:51:55,988 --> 00:51:56,822
Yep.

664
00:51:58,115 --> 00:52:01,535
- [bugs chirring]
- [animal yipping in distance]

665
00:52:28,812 --> 00:52:31,231
What're you doing up?
Not supposed to relieve me until 3:00.

666
00:52:31,315 --> 00:52:33,233
I'm done sleeping for the night.

667
00:52:33,901 --> 00:52:34,735
Okay.

668
00:52:36,654 --> 00:52:37,738
Come look at this.

669
00:52:41,283 --> 00:52:42,618
Okay, this is where we are...

670
00:52:44,328 --> 00:52:45,746
and that's the lighthouse.

671
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:48,165
Southwest is Ville Perdu.

672
00:52:48,248 --> 00:52:50,959
It's a small community we evacuated
two years ago.

673
00:52:51,585 --> 00:52:54,254
I think we should head there tomorrow,

674
00:52:54,922 --> 00:52:57,675
and then head out for the coast
the following morning.

675
00:53:01,136 --> 00:53:01,970
Good.

676
00:53:07,434 --> 00:53:08,435
You okay?

677
00:53:14,650 --> 00:53:16,151
I was gonna say, when...

678
00:53:16,944 --> 00:53:19,321
you didn't tell the team
about your connection to Kane,

679
00:53:19,405 --> 00:53:21,365
I wasn't sure if that was a good idea.

680
00:53:23,909 --> 00:53:25,953
But after seeing that footage...

681
00:53:29,206 --> 00:53:30,040
yeah.

682
00:53:30,958 --> 00:53:33,377
I'm not sure how they would have reacted
to you.

683
00:53:36,255 --> 00:53:38,424
Why did my husband volunteer
for a suicide mission?

684
00:53:39,133 --> 00:53:40,801
Is that what you think we're doing?

685
00:53:41,635 --> 00:53:43,804
- Committing suicide?
- You must have profiled him,

686
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:45,264
you must have assessed him.

687
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:48,183
He must have said something.

688
00:53:49,685 --> 00:53:51,895
So you're asking me as a psychologist.

689
00:53:53,689 --> 00:53:54,523
Yeah.

690
00:53:55,941 --> 00:53:57,693
Then, as a psychologist...

691
00:53:58,694 --> 00:54:02,281
I'd say you're confusing suicide
with self-destruction.

692
00:54:04,783 --> 00:54:07,035
Almost none of us commit suicide...

693
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:10,080
and almost all of us self-destruct.

694
00:54:10,289 --> 00:54:12,958
In some way, in some part of our lives.

695
00:54:14,293 --> 00:54:16,920
We drink, or we smoke.

696
00:54:17,379 --> 00:54:19,506
We destabilize the good job.

697
00:54:21,884 --> 00:54:23,177
Or the happy marriage.

698
00:54:28,474 --> 00:54:30,476
These aren't decisions, they're...

699
00:54:31,393 --> 00:54:32,561
They're impulses.

700
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:37,941
In fact, you're probably better equipped
to explain this than I am.

701
00:54:38,025 --> 00:54:39,568
- What does that mean?
- [scoffs]

702
00:54:39,985 --> 00:54:41,236
You're a biologist.

703
00:54:42,613 --> 00:54:45,032
Isn't self-destruction coded into us?

704
00:54:45,449 --> 00:54:46,909
Programmed into each cell?

705
00:54:48,535 --> 00:54:49,745
[crashing]

706
00:54:49,870 --> 00:54:50,871
What was that?

707
00:54:50,954 --> 00:54:52,456
- [chambers round]
- Don't know.

708
00:54:52,790 --> 00:54:55,042
- [creature growling nearby]
- [gasps]

709
00:55:04,384 --> 00:55:05,302
Josie, wake up.

710
00:55:05,552 --> 00:55:07,763
Wake up, Josie, come on.
Wake up. Something's happening.

711
00:55:08,222 --> 00:55:10,015
- Do you see anything?
- No.

712
00:55:10,516 --> 00:55:12,100
[Cassie] What happened? I heard a noise.

713
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:14,812
- [Lena] Oh.
- [Cassie] What?

714
00:55:17,648 --> 00:55:19,024
Something's come through the fence.

715
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:22,778
- <i>Through</i> the fence?
- It's ripped open like a fucking zipper.

716
00:55:22,861 --> 00:55:25,239
[panting]

717
00:55:26,573 --> 00:55:27,783
[twigs snapping]

718
00:55:28,367 --> 00:55:29,201
[Ventress] Can't see.

719
00:55:29,284 --> 00:55:30,786
- Yeah, neither can I.
- [rustling]

720
00:55:30,869 --> 00:55:32,704
- [roars]
- [Cassie screams]

721
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:34,122
Sheppard!

722
00:55:34,206 --> 00:55:35,833
- [Cassie screaming]
- [Lena] Sheppard!

723
00:55:35,916 --> 00:55:37,876
- Fuck!
- What's going on?

724
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:39,837
Sheppard was next to me.
Something took her.

725
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:40,838
[growling]

726
00:55:40,921 --> 00:55:43,924
- [Cassie continues screaming]
- Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck! Sheppard!

727
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:44,842
[Anya] Oh, shit!

728
00:55:44,925 --> 00:55:48,554
- [creature growls]
- [Cassie shrieks] Help! Help me!

729
00:55:48,637 --> 00:55:50,639
[screams continue in distance]

730
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:53,225
[Anya] Shepp...

731
00:55:56,603 --> 00:55:57,813
Sheppard!

732
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:03,485
Sheppard!

733
00:56:33,181 --> 00:56:34,224
We have to go back.

734
00:56:34,808 --> 00:56:37,060
- We have to go back now.
- [Anya] She's right.

735
00:56:37,311 --> 00:56:39,062
[Ventress] Right? In what sense?

736
00:56:39,146 --> 00:56:40,606
[Anya] We've been attacked twice.

737
00:56:40,856 --> 00:56:42,733
- [sighs]
- [Anya] We lost one of our own.

738
00:56:42,816 --> 00:56:45,944
We have evidence the previous team
went nuts and chopped each other up.

739
00:56:46,028 --> 00:56:48,447
I really don't know how much more right
she has to be.

740
00:56:48,530 --> 00:56:50,157
We haven't reached the lighthouse.

741
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:53,160
We still don't understand the cause
or the nature of the Shimmer.

742
00:56:53,243 --> 00:56:55,704
We have data, observations, photographs.
She has hella footage.

743
00:56:55,787 --> 00:56:59,499
All of which makes the phenomenon
less explicable, not more.

744
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:03,754
I'm gonna get to the lighthouse,

745
00:57:03,837 --> 00:57:05,756
and I'm fine going on my own.

746
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:10,093
You just need to decide...
whether you're coming with me or not.

747
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:24,316
It's like she hasn't noticed
that Sheppard is dead.

748
00:57:24,399 --> 00:57:25,567
She's crazy.

749
00:57:25,776 --> 00:57:27,569
She's a crazy old bitch.

750
00:57:28,737 --> 00:57:31,281
You know,
and thanks for the fucking backup, Lena.

751
00:57:32,574 --> 00:57:34,743
- I didn't realize there were sides.
- [Anya] Yeah.

752
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:36,078
Yeah, there are sides.

753
00:57:37,371 --> 00:57:40,207
Okay, then I agree with you.
We should go back.

754
00:57:41,083 --> 00:57:43,126
Good. Okay, great. There we go. Okay?

755
00:57:43,210 --> 00:57:45,504
- So the three of us can...
- [Lena] Hold on a minute.

756
00:57:45,587 --> 00:57:46,964
We should go back, yes.

757
00:57:47,047 --> 00:57:49,216
But it took us, what,
six days to get here?

758
00:57:49,591 --> 00:57:51,927
And the coast is two days away.

759
00:57:52,928 --> 00:57:55,347
And as Sheppard said...

760
00:57:56,348 --> 00:57:59,726
when we get to the coast,
we can follow it until the perimeter wall.

761
00:58:00,185 --> 00:58:01,937
You're saying we get out
by going deeper?

762
00:58:02,688 --> 00:58:04,690
- Yeah, if you like, yeah.
- "Like"?

763
00:58:05,065 --> 00:58:07,693
No, I don't fucking "like."

764
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:14,783
This isn't some bullshit tactic
to get us to the lighthouse, is it?

765
00:58:14,866 --> 00:58:17,202
This is not about the lighthouse, okay?

766
00:58:17,995 --> 00:58:20,038
I believe that the coast
is the best route out.

767
00:58:24,835 --> 00:58:25,669
Okay?

768
00:58:39,224 --> 00:58:40,225
You lied to them.

769
00:58:43,645 --> 00:58:45,689
I didn't know what going back meant.

770
00:58:46,398 --> 00:58:48,859
Why it would be safer than going forward.

771
00:58:50,110 --> 00:58:53,780
[man] You didn't know, but you made
a decision to continue as if you did.

772
00:58:53,947 --> 00:58:55,282
Ventress made the decision.

773
00:58:55,365 --> 00:58:58,160
[man] Ventress had cancer.
She was never coming back.

774
00:58:59,494 --> 00:59:00,829
You knew she was sick.

775
00:59:01,747 --> 00:59:02,664
I had guessed.

776
00:59:06,084 --> 00:59:07,711
And you wanted to continue.

777
00:59:09,963 --> 00:59:10,797
Yes.

778
00:59:12,174 --> 00:59:13,008
I did.

779
00:59:36,615 --> 00:59:38,617
[flies buzzing]

780
01:00:00,347 --> 01:00:01,890
She could still be alive.

781
01:00:01,973 --> 01:00:03,433
It's highly doubtful.

782
01:00:05,227 --> 01:00:06,269
We need to know.

783
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:08,188
[panting softly]

784
01:00:09,356 --> 01:00:10,190
Go.

785
01:00:11,233 --> 01:00:12,067
Fine.

786
01:00:14,820 --> 01:00:15,695
I'm coming with you.

787
01:00:17,322 --> 01:00:18,198
I'll go alone.

788
01:00:31,169 --> 01:00:33,421
[animal trilling in distance]

789

[flies buzzing]

01:02:04,346 --> 01:02:05,513
[sighs]

795
01:02:06,806 --> 01:02:08,266
[controlled exhale]

796
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:48,473
[Josie] Did you find her?

797
01:02:49,307 --> 01:02:50,141
Yeah.

798
01:02:51,643 --> 01:02:52,477
She's dead.

799
01:03:17,502 --> 01:03:18,420
You okay?

800
01:03:19,421 --> 01:03:22,632
Fine. Just... leave me the fuck alone.

801
01:03:49,075 --> 01:03:50,827
[Ventress] We'll camp here tonight.

802
01:03:51,911 --> 01:03:54,122
It's another two hours' walk up the coast.

803
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:33,745
They've grown this way.

804
01:04:34,788 --> 01:04:36,247
That doesn't make any sense.

805
01:04:37,082 --> 01:04:38,249
I think it does.

806
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:51,137
At first I thought the radio waves
were blocked by the Shimmer,

807
01:04:51,221 --> 01:04:55,350
and that's why no one inside
could communicate with base or GPS,

808
01:04:55,433 --> 01:05:00,688
but the light waves aren't blocked,
they're refracted, and...

809
01:05:03,566 --> 01:05:05,402
- [clicks]
- [static]

810
01:05:05,485 --> 01:05:07,278
...it's the same with the radios.

811
01:05:07,987 --> 01:05:09,489
The signals aren't gone.

812
01:05:10,073 --> 01:05:11,408
They're scrambled.

813
01:05:12,283 --> 01:05:13,118
[clicks]

814
01:05:14,244 --> 01:05:15,245
[scoffs]

815
01:05:17,664 --> 01:05:19,165
That leaf in your hand...

816
01:05:20,375 --> 01:05:22,168
know what you'd get if you sequenced it?

817
01:05:23,086 --> 01:05:25,380
- What?
- Human Hox genes.

818
01:05:25,463 --> 01:05:27,006
Hox? What is... What's Hox mean?

819
01:05:27,882 --> 01:05:31,928
They're the genes that define
the body plan, the physical structure.

820
01:05:34,097 --> 01:05:36,224
And the plants have human body plan.

821
01:05:36,307 --> 01:05:40,770
Arms attached to shoulders. Legs to hips.

822
01:05:40,854 --> 01:05:42,480
It's literally not possible.

823
01:05:42,730 --> 01:05:44,357
It's literally what's happening.

824
01:05:46,985 --> 01:05:50,655
The Shimmer is a prism,
but it refracts everything.

825
01:05:51,489 --> 01:05:53,867
Not just light and radio waves.

826
01:05:54,451 --> 01:05:57,620
Animal DNA, plant DNA...

827
01:05:58,705 --> 01:06:00,039
all DNA.

828
01:06:00,540 --> 01:06:01,958
What do you mean, "all DNA"?

829
01:06:02,876 --> 01:06:04,627
She's talking about our DNA.

830
01:06:07,505 --> 01:06:08,882
She's talking about us.

831
01:06:48,338 --> 01:06:49,214
[door closes]

832
01:07:15,532 --> 01:07:18,159
All right... I guess this is a bedroom.

833
01:07:19,702 --> 01:07:21,538
Let's secure doors and windows.

834
01:08:17,010 --> 01:08:18,553
[gasps]

835
01:08:27,020 --> 01:08:29,022
[Lena panting]

836
01:08:32,567 --> 01:08:33,693
[gasps]

837
01:08:39,365 --> 01:08:40,283
[Lena moans]

838
01:08:47,290 --> 01:08:49,000
This was a mistake.

839
01:08:51,294 --> 01:08:52,128
Okay.

840
01:08:58,926 --> 01:09:01,554
You spend more time
away from your husband than with him.

841
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:06,893
You can't talk to him about work,
and he won't talk to you about his.

842
01:09:06,976 --> 01:09:10,980
And there is a clear physical
and intellectual connection between us.

843
01:09:11,064 --> 01:09:13,149
- Have I covered the bases?
- You forgot your wife.

844
01:09:13,232 --> 01:09:14,442
I love my wife.

845
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:18,738
She's blameless in this.

846
01:09:27,330 --> 01:09:28,206
Come on, Lena.

847
01:09:29,957 --> 01:09:31,584
What's really going on here?

848
01:09:33,670 --> 01:09:36,005
You think that something
may have happened to him?

849
01:09:41,052 --> 01:09:42,387
Or you think he knows.

850
01:09:45,264 --> 01:09:46,307
That's it, isn't it?

851
01:09:47,266 --> 01:09:49,894
You think somehow he's found out
about our affair.

852
01:09:52,105 --> 01:09:53,147
Has he found out?

853
01:09:54,482 --> 01:09:55,316
[Lena] Yes.

854
01:09:59,070 --> 01:09:59,946
You should go.

855
01:10:02,448 --> 01:10:03,866
- No, Lena, I...
- Dan...

856
01:10:04,867 --> 01:10:08,830
I'm not interested in talking...
or in anything you have to say.

857
01:10:10,039 --> 01:10:11,541
Just get dressed and get out.

858
01:10:14,377 --> 01:10:17,046
You know, it's not me you hate,
it's yourself.

859
01:10:20,508 --> 01:10:21,968
No, Dan, it's you, too.

860
01:10:26,139 --> 01:10:27,640
It's never gonna happen again.

861
01:10:34,105 --> 01:10:35,606
You lying bitch!

862
01:10:36,816 --> 01:10:38,526
- What's going on?
- No.

863
01:10:39,277 --> 01:10:42,196
You don't get to ask
that fucking question. You answer it!

864
01:11:01,507 --> 01:11:02,842

[Lena panting]

867
01:11:11,726 --> 01:11:12,560
Brother.

868
01:11:15,021 --> 01:11:15,855
Boyfriend.

869
01:11:17,982 --> 01:11:18,816
Husband.

870
01:11:22,904 --> 01:11:24,113
Husband.

871
01:11:26,365 --> 01:11:29,327
- [Anya] Why didn't you tell us?
- [speaks indistinctly]

872
01:11:30,661 --> 01:11:33,790
- You knew. Obviously.
- [panting]

873
01:11:37,877 --> 01:11:40,713
- Did you know?
- [breath quavering]

874
01:11:42,590 --> 01:11:44,509
- [Josie sobs]
- Okay.

875
01:11:45,176 --> 01:11:46,010
[sniffles]

876
01:11:49,222 --> 01:11:51,265
There are two theories
of what went wrong.

877
01:11:51,349 --> 01:11:52,975
One is that something in here killed them.

878
01:11:53,059 --> 01:11:56,896
Two... is that they went crazy
and they killed each other.

879
01:11:58,731 --> 01:12:00,900
Josie nearly got killed by an alligator,

880
01:12:00,983 --> 01:12:03,611
and Cass did get killed by a bear.
[voice breaks]

881
01:12:06,113 --> 01:12:08,199
So, yes, theory one, it fits.

882
01:12:11,452 --> 01:12:12,286
But...

883
01:12:15,248 --> 01:12:16,958
I didn't actually see a bear.

884
01:12:18,459 --> 01:12:19,627
And neither did Josie.

885
01:12:19,794 --> 01:12:20,711
[Ventress grunts]

886
01:12:20,795 --> 01:12:22,922
[Anya] The only people who saw
were Lena and Ventress.

887
01:12:23,464 --> 01:12:26,175
So nothing's confirmed.
Everything's on their word.

888
01:12:26,551 --> 01:12:30,888
- Everything's on Lena's word.
- [speaks indistinctly]

889
01:12:31,264 --> 01:12:32,682
And what we know now...

890
01:12:34,141 --> 01:12:37,019
what we know,

891
01:12:37,395 --> 01:12:40,648
is that Lena... is a liar.

892
01:12:40,731 --> 01:12:42,817
- [speaks indistinctly]
- Shut the fuck up!

893
01:12:44,485 --> 01:12:48,155
Lena... you're a liar.

894
01:12:51,242 --> 01:12:52,076
Did you kill Cass?

895
01:12:52,618 --> 01:12:54,537
[speaks indistinctly]

896
01:12:54,996 --> 01:12:56,372
Did you lose your shit?

897
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:02,420
Or do you think I've lost my shit
and we're gonna fuck each other up?

898
01:13:02,503 --> 01:13:03,838
That's theory two.

899
01:13:04,630 --> 01:13:06,173
[Ventress speaks indistinctly]

900
01:13:06,966 --> 01:13:08,509
[exhales, sniffles]

901
01:13:09,635 --> 01:13:10,845
Oh, God.

902
01:13:15,641 --> 01:13:17,310
When I look at my hands...

903
01:13:18,311 --> 01:13:19,729
and my fingerprints...

904
01:13:21,439 --> 01:13:22,565
I can see them moving.

905
01:13:22,732 --> 01:13:24,483
[speaks indistinctly]

906
01:13:26,110 --> 01:13:29,238
[sobbing] I can't.

907
01:13:30,114 --> 01:13:31,616
If I let you go,

908
01:13:32,074 --> 01:13:34,744
and you tie me to a chair
and cut me open...

909
01:13:36,495 --> 01:13:39,957
are my insides gonna move
like my fingerprints?

910
01:13:40,249 --> 01:13:44,545
[panting, exhales deeply]

911
01:13:47,381 --> 01:13:51,218
But... I'm not the one tied to a chair.

912
01:13:51,552 --> 01:13:53,471
[grunts]

913
01:13:55,431 --> 01:13:56,599
- [Ventress gasps]
- You are.

914
01:13:56,682 --> 01:13:59,018
[Ventress and Lena shouting indistinctly]

915
01:14:01,354 --> 01:14:03,314

01:14:09,779 --> 01:14:11,322
[panting] Oh, Cass?

920
01:14:13,115 --> 01:14:14,283
[knife clatters]

921
01:14:14,367 --> 01:14:16,786
- You said she was dead.
- [Lena speaks indistinctly]

922
01:14:16,994 --> 01:14:19,455
- [Anya] Cass! Cass, I'm coming!

01:15:12,675 --> 01:15:15,011
Help!

[Josie whimpers]

932
01:15:29,608 --> 01:15:30,651
Don't react.

933
01:15:31,444 --> 01:15:32,445
Mmm.

934
01:15:38,284 --> 01:15:41,328

[panting]

960
01:17:42,366 --> 01:17:43,826
What are you doing?

961
01:17:44,201 --> 01:17:46,203
- I'm leaving.
- [Lena] Now?

962
01:17:48,581 --> 01:17:51,208
- It's not even light yet.
- I don't have time to wait.

963
01:17:51,625 --> 01:17:53,252
We are disintegrating.

964
01:17:53,335 --> 01:17:55,421
Our bodies as fast as our minds.
Can't you feel it?

965
01:17:57,131 --> 01:17:59,049
It's like the onset of dementia.

966
01:18:02,094 --> 01:18:03,762
If I don't reach the lighthouse soon...

967
01:18:04,471 --> 01:18:07,892
the person that started this journey
won't be the person that ends it.

968
01:18:08,225 --> 01:18:10,102
I want to be the one that ends it.

969

[sighs]

970
01:19:12,498 --> 01:19:13,874
We should go, Josie.

971
01:19:21,924 --> 01:19:24,093
How long was your husband in the Shimmer?

972
01:19:26,220 --> 01:19:28,097
It's hard to say exactly.

973
01:19:31,100 --> 01:19:33,143
Theoretically, as long as a year.

974
01:19:35,646 --> 01:19:38,941
That's a long time to be inside
and remain intact.
